This is unchanged in size compared to 8/9/2023. Thoracic inlet: No supraclavicular adenopathy. Heart and great vessels: Heart is normal in size. Extensive three-vessel coronary calcifications and/or stents. No pericardial effusion. Mildly ectatic ascending thoracic aorta measuring 4.0 cm in diameter. Severe calcified atherosclerosis of the aortic arch and proximal great vessels. Mediastinum and hila: Evaluation of mediastinal and hilar lymphadenopathy is somewhat limited by contrast phase and streak artifact. Interval enlargement of a pathologically enlarged right cardiophrenic lymph node measuring 2.2 x 2.9 cm, previously 1.9 x 2.4 cm (series 5, image 281). Small hiatal hernia. Airway, lungs, and pleura: Central airways are patent. Diffuse bronchial wall thickening. Interval enlargement in number of innumerable pulmonary metastases, multiple which are cavitary. Multiple new pulmonary nodules. * Dominant cavitary lesion in the left upper lobe now measures 3.0 x 2.6 cm (series 5, image 117), previously 1.9 x 1.8 cm. * Dominant mass in the right lower lobe measures 4.1 x 4.0 cm (series 5, image 204), previously 3.2 x 3.1 cm. Small right pleural effusion. Chest wall and axilla: Diffuse soft tissue anasarca. Symmetric gynecomastia. Bones and soft tissues: Diffuse bone demineralization. L1 hemangioma. Multilevel thoracic spondylosis. Exaggerated kyphosis. Upper abdomen: Extensive circumferential visceral arterial calcifications. Increased size of partially imaged mass is between the superior right kidney and liver measuring 2.6 and 2.0 cm in disease series 5, image 3051). IMPRESSION: 1. No acute pulmonary embolism to the segmental level. 2. Compared to 8/9/2023, interval progression of metastatic disease throughout the lungs, chest, and upper abdomen as described above. 3.

No COMPARISON: CT chest 2/2/2023. TECHNIQUE: Contrast enhanced chest CT performed during the injection of 65 ml of Isovue 370. Three-dimensional (MIP) reconstructions and multiplanar reformats were performed. FINDINGS: CTA findings: No acute pulmonary embolism to the segmental level. Main pulmonary artery normal in caliber. No interventricular septal bowing to suggest acute right heart strain. Thyroid: The visualized thyroid gland is normal. Thoracic inlet: No supraclavicular adenopathy. Heart and great vessels: Heart size is normal. No pericardial effusion. Unchanged caliber of the ascending thoracic aorta measuring 3.7 cm. Interval placement of a dual lead pacemaker with generator in the left anterior chest wall and leads within the right atrium and right ventricle. Slight atypical upper curvature of the right ventricular lead with apparent interventricular positioning of the distal tip although this may be related to motion artifact. Mediastinum and hila: No mediastinal or hilar adenopathy by size criteria. Esophagus appears normal. Airway, lungs, and pleura: Central airways are patent. Mild bilateral dependent atelectasis. Scarring along the posterior medial right lower lobe related to adjacent thoracic spine osteophytes. Stable 3 mm pulmonary nodule in the right upper lobe (series 7, image 21). These have been stable since 2021. No pneumothorax or pleural effusion. Chest wall and axilla: No axillary adenopathy. Bones and soft tissues: Moderate multilevel degenerative changes of the thoracic spine. No suspicious osseous lesions. Upper abdomen: No acute findings. IMPRESSION: 1. No acute pulmonary embolism. 2. Interval placement of a dual lead pacemaker with atypical positioning of the distal right ventricular lead with superior curvature and possible positioning within the interventricular septum. This is not well evaluated on non gated study, can be further evaluated with gated cardiac CT if clinically indicated. 3. Stable punctate pulmonary nodules since 2021. Per Fleischner criteria, no further evaluation is recommended based on stability. 4. Unchanged diameter of the ascending thoracic aorta. Attending review: I have reviewed the resident preliminary report and agree with the findings. ________________________________________________ This exam was interpreted by a University of Colorado School of Medicine radiology physician.

TECHNIQUE: Using multidetector CT, contrast enhanced chest CT was performed with contrast in pulmonary arterial phase. Three-dimensional (MIP) reconstructions were performed. Three-dimensional coronal and sagittal MIP reconstructions were performed. CONTRAST: Isovue 370 100 mL COMPARISON: CT PE 12/22/2023 FINDINGS: CTA: Contrast bolus timing allows for adequate evaluation to the level of the segmental pulmonary arteries. No filling defect to suggest pulmonary embolus. No findings to suggest right heart strain. Previously seen right lower lobe segmental pulmonary arterial emboli is no longer visualized. Thyroid: Visualized portions are normal. Thoracic inlet: No supraclavicular lymphadenopathy. Mediastinum and hila: Unchanged prominent subcarinal lymph node measuring 1.4 cm (7/245). Left hilar lymph node measuring 1.6 cm, progressed from prior (6/148), likely reactive. Patulous esophagus dilated with fluid, with an enteric tube coursing into the gastric fundus. Heart and great vessels: Normal size of the heart. Trace pericardial fluid. Normal size of the great vessels. Lungs, airway and pleura: Similar narrowing of the intrathoracic trachea in anterior posterior dimension. Extensive debris is seen within the left greater than right main stem bronchi increased bilateral mucous plugging. There is near complete obliteration of the left lower lobe bronchi. Increased heterogenously enhancing consolidative opacity in the left lower lobe lung (6/158). Slightly increased right basilar consolidation/atelectasis. New irregular focal consolidation in the posterior superior segment of the left upper lobe lung (6/120). There is new extensive tree in bud nodularity throughout the left upper lobe lung and bilateral lower lobes. New nodule is seen within the left upper lobe lung on average measuring 0.6 cm (6/148). No pleural effusion or pneumothorax. Breast and axilla: No axillary lymphadenopathy. Upper abdomen: Visualized portions of the upper abdomen are unremarkable. Bones and Soft Tissues: There is mild degenerative change of the spine. Prominent anterior osteophytes in the lower cervical spine. No aggressive osseous lesion. Superficial soft tissues are within normal limits. IMPRESSION: 1. No central peripheral pulmonary embolus. 2. New extensive debris/secretions throughout the central airways with increased bibasilar mucous plugging and areas of consolidation concerning for aspiration pneumonia. 3. Extensive tree in bud nodularity is suggestive of aspiration. However, superimposed bronchiolitis is a differential consideration. Recommend attention follow up to confirm resolution. 4. Again seen small AP diameter of the intrathoracic trachea. Tracheomalacia is a differential consideration. Upon resolution of acute illness, follow-up CT chest with inspiratory and expiratory phases may be considered for further evaluation.

            "answer": "CTA CHEST FOR PE DATE OF EXAM: 02/19/2024, 2108 INDICATION: History of pulmonary embolism on eliquis. Patient presents with fatigue and chest pain. High clinical suspicion for pulmonary embolism. Was there a contrast reaction? No Was there a contrast or saline extravasation? No TECHNIQUE: Using multidetector CT, contrast enhanced chest CT was performed with contrast in pulmonary arterial phase. Three-dimensional (MIP) reconstructions were performed. Three-dimensional coronal and sagittal MIP reconstructions were performed. CONTRAST: Isovue 370 65 mL COMPARISON: CTA dated 5/3/2022. FINDINGS: CTA: Contrast bolus timing allows for adequate evaluation to the level of the segmental pulmonary arteries. No filling defect to suggest pulmonary embolus. Thyroid: Visualized portions are normal. Thoracic inlet: No supraclavicular lymphadenopathy. Mediastinum and hila: No mediastinal or hilar lymphadenopathy. Mild thickening of the distal thoracic esophagus again seen.. Heart and great vessels: Borderline enlarged. Mild flattening of the interventricular septum. No significant coronary artery calcifications. Trace pericardial effusion, likely physiologic. Normal caliber thoracic aorta. Borderline dilated main pulmonary artery. Lungs, airway and pleura: The central airways are patent. No consolidative opacities. Scattered minimal reticular opacities. No suspicious pulmonary nodule. No pleural effusion or pneumothorax. Breast and axilla: Visualized breast tissue is symmetric. No axillary lymphadenopathy. Upper abdomen: Visualized portions of the upper abdomen are unremarkable. Bones and Soft Tissues: No aggressive osseous lesion. Superficial soft tissues are within normal limits. IMPRESSION: 1. No pulmonary embolism to the level of the segmental arteries. 2. Flattening of the interventricular septum and borderline enlarged main pulmonary artery may reflect right heart strain in the correct clinical setting. 3. Stable mild wall thickening of the distal thoracic esophagus which may be secondary to inflammation. Correlate with clinical symptoms.

            "answer": "CTA CHEST FOR PE CLINICAL INDICATION: Pulmonary embolism suspected. TECHNIQUE: Helical tomographic images of the chest were obtained following administration of 60 mL Isovue 370 intravenous contrast. No contrast reaction or contrast/saline extravasation was reported. Multiplanar reformats are provided. COMPARISON: CTA chest 5/22/2023 FINDINGS: Included neck base demonstrates no acute abnormality. No adenopathy by CT size criteria. Left-sided arch with conventional 3 vessel branching. The ascending aorta is mildly ectatic. No pulmonary trunk is enlarged, measuring up to 3.5 cm. No segmental or larger pulmonary embolism. Heart size is enlarged. No large pericardial effusion. No pleural effusion. There are dependent changes bilaterally. There are groundglass and consolidative opacities along left greater than right lower lobes and the posterior/inferior aspect of the left upper lobe. There is some nodularity in the left lung opacities. No pneumothorax. The central airways are clear. No acute abnormality in the bones and soft tissues. Included abdomen demonstrates no acute abnormality within the limitations of contrast timing. Small hiatal hernia. IMPRESSION: 1. No CT evidence of segmental or larger pulmonary embolism. 2. The pulmonary trunk is enlarged, suggestive of pulmonary hypertension. 3. Groundglass and consolidative opacities along the left greater than right lower lobes and the posterior/inferior aspect of the left upper lobe. There is some nodularity in the left lung opacities. This likely represents infectious/inflammatory process, although malignancy cannot be entirely ruled out with the nodularity. Recommend follow-up to ensure resolution. 4. Small hiatal hernia.

            "answer": "CTA Chest for PE DATE OF EXAM: 2/23/2024 INDICATION: Pulmonary embolism suspected, high probability TECHNIQUE: Using multidetector CT, contrast enhanced chest CT was performed with contrast in pulmonary arterial phase. Three-dimensional (MIP) reconstructions were performed. Three-dimensional coronal and sagittal MIP reconstructions were performed. CONTRAST: Isovue 370 75 mL COMPARISON: CT abdomen pelvis 3/20/2022. FINDINGS: CTA: Contrast bolus timing allows for adequate evaluation to the level of the segmental pulmonary arteries. No filling defect to suggest pulmonary embolus. No findings to suggest right heart strain. Thyroid: Visualized portions are normal. Thoracic inlet: No supraclavicular lymphadenopathy. Mediastinum and hila: There is likely right hilar and peribronchial lymphadenopathy, inseparable from the adjacent right upper lobe consolidation. Patulous distal esophagus. Heart and great vessels: Normal size of the heart. No significant pericardial effusion. Normal size of the great vessels. Lungs, airway and pleura: The central airways are patent. Diffuse peribronchial thickening. Hypoenhancing consolidation of the majority of the right upper lobe , with some sparing of the anterior and apical portions. There is inferior and posterior bulging of the right major and minor fissures. Low right lung volumes and subsegmental atelectasis of the right lower lobe lung. No suspicious pulmonary nodule. No pleural effusion or pneumothorax. Breast and axilla: No axillary lymphadenopathy. Upper abdomen: Visualized portions of the upper abdomen are unremarkable. Bones and Soft Tissues: Subacute appearing transverse impacted manubrial fracture with adjacent soft tissue swelling (904/225). There is mild soft tissue edema along the anterior superior mediastinum adjacent to the manubrial fracture. Subacute posterior bilateral posterior first and second rib fractures. Additional nondisplaced subacute left posterior third and fifth rib fractures. Multilevel compression deformities throughout the thoracic spine including the superior endplates of T5, T6 T8 and T9 vertebral bodies. No aggressive osseous lesion. Mild diffuse soft tissue anasarca. IMPRESSION: 1. No evidence of central or segmental pulmonary embolus. 2. Near complete consolidation of the right upper lobe is concerning for lobar pneumonia. Recommend attention on follow-up CT to confirm resolution upon clinical improvement and exclude underlying persistent neoplastic lesion. 3. Multiple subacute healing fractures involving the manubrium ribs as described. Additionally, there are multiple compression deformities throughout the thoracic spine with minimal height loss. Follow-up with nonemergent MR of the thoracic spine for further characterization of injuries may be considered.

Three-dimensional (MIP) reconstructions were performed. Three-dimensional coronal and sagittal MIP reconstructions were performed. CONTRAST: Isovue 370 100 mL COMPARISON: CT chest without contrast 7/20/2015 FINDINGS: CTA: Suboptimal contrast bolus, with only adequate opacification to the level of the proximal segmental arteries, without acute pulmonary embolism identified. Thyroid: Visualized portions are normal. Thoracic inlet: No definitive supraclavicular adenopathy. Mediastinum and hila: There are multiple prominent to mildly enlarged mediastinal lymph nodes, which are stable to mildly decreased compared to prior, with prevascular lymph nodes measuring up to 9 mm, stable. Ill-defined right paratracheal lymph node measures up to 15 mm in short axis, unchanged. Ill-defined hilar adenopathy, greater on the left, also appears similar to prior, with the left hilum measuring up to 15 mm in the right measuring up to 15 mm. Heart and great vessels: Heart is enlarged. Prior median sternotomy and prosthetic mitral valve replacement. Thoracic aorta are not well opacified for dissection evaluation, normal caliber. Main pulmonary artery measures up to 3.3 cm which may suggest pulmonary hypertension. Trace suggestive LAD coronary artery calcifications. Lungs, airway and pleura: Expiratory imaging. Central airways are patent. Moderate diffuse bronchial wall thickening with areas of mild central bronchial narrowing secondary to hilar adenopathy/soft tissue fullness, notably of the right middle lobe bronchus and bilateral lower lobe central bronchi. Distal mucoid impaction is noted within bilateral lower lobes and the lingula. Patchy groundglass and linear opacities are present throughout with associated smooth interlobular and perilobular septal thickening, notably in the lung bases. Bibasilar linear opacities with more nodular consolidation of the right lung base, favoring atelectasis or scarring, given prior CT. No significant pleural effusion. No pneumothorax. Breast and axilla: No axillary lymphadenopathy. Upper abdomen: Partially visualized cardiomegaly. Further evaluation the abdomen limited secondary to soft tissue attenuation/photon starvation. Bones and Soft Tissues: Prior median sternotomy without acute complication. No acute bony or soft tissue abnormality. IMPRESSION: 1. Negative for acute PE to the level of the proximal segmental arteries. 2. Cardiomegaly with hazy groundglass and linear abnormalities throughout the lung, with associated septal thickening. Findings are nonspecific, but favoring underlying pulmonary edema. 3. Superimposed moderate to severe bronchial wall thickening with lower lung predominant distal mucoid impaction and associated atelectasis, greatest in the right lung base. Findings are nonspecific, possibly secondary to history of asthma. 4. Mediastinal and hilar adenopathy with resultant central bronchial narrowing secondary to hilar adenopathy/soft tissue fullness, overall unchanged from 2015. Superimposed mild perilymphatic/perifissural nodularity, increased from 2015. Query underlying sarcoidosis.

Sagittal, coronal and slab 3D MIP coronal reconstructed images were also created for further evaluation and interpretation. One of the following dose optimization techniques was utilized in the performance of this exam: Automated exposure control; adjustment of the mA and/or kV according to the patient's size; or use of an iterative reconstruction technique. Specific details can be referenced in the facility's radiology CT exam operational policy. CONTRAST: Isovue-370, 75 mL COMPARISON: Chest radiograph from 2/14/2024 FINDINGS: CHEST WALL: No axillary adenopathy. Based thyroid is unremarkable. No supraclavicular adenopathy. Heart/vessels: Heart is normal in size. Main pulmonary artery is adequately opacified with contrast to the proximal segmental level. There is no evidence of central pulmonary embolism. Moderate degradation of the inferior images due to respiratory motion artifact. Mediastinum: Negative. Lymph nodes: There are enlarged right and left hilar lymph nodes, for instance, a right hilar lymph node on series 4 image 163 measures 2.1 x 1.4 cm. An enlarged left hilar lymph node on series 4 image 169 measures 2.2 x 1.6 and meters. Lungs/pleura: Diffuse small airways thickening.

            "answer": "CTA CHEST FOR PE DATE OF EXAM: 2/7/2024 INDICATION: Pulmonary embolism suspected, high probability TECHNIQUE: Using multidetector CT, contrast enhanced chest CT was performed with contrast in pulmonary arterial phase. Three-dimensional (MIP) reconstructions were performed. Three-dimensional coronal and sagittal MIP reconstructions were performed. CONTRAST: Isovue 370 50 mL COMPARISON: None FINDINGS: CTA: Contrast bolus timing allows for adequate evaluation to the level of the segmental pulmonary arteries. No filling defect to suggest pulmonary embolus. No findings to suggest right heart strain. Thyroid: Visualized portions are normal. Thoracic inlet: No supraclavicular lymphadenopathy. Mediastinum and hila: No mediastinal or hilar lymphadenopathy. The thoracic esophagus is unremarkable. Heart and great vessels: Four-chamber cardiac enlargement. There is some reflux of contrast into the IVC and hepatic veins. No significant pericardial effusion. Normal size of the great vessels. Lungs, airway and pleura: The central airways are patent. Mild peribronchial thickening. Multifocal centrilobular consolidative opacities and central portions of the right upper lobe lung (7/81). In the right lower lobe lung there is a nonenhancing consolidation (7/171). There is likely superimposed atelectasis at the lung bases. Additional nodular consolidative opacities in the left lower lobe lung, with one measuring 1.4 x 0.8 cm (7/127). No pleural effusion or pneumothorax. Breast and axilla: No axillary lymphadenopathy. Upper abdomen: Borderline low attenuation throughout the hepatic parenchyma. Bones and Soft Tissues: There is mild degenerative change of the spine. No aggressive osseous lesion. Superficial soft tissues are within normal limits. IMPRESSION: 1. No central or peripheral pulmonary embolus. 2. Nonspecific new soft tissue thickening along the ascending aorta probably pericardial recess fluid, less likely intramural hematoma or inflammatory arteritis. If clinically warranted follow-up with dedicated CTA dissection protocol of the chest is suggested for further evaluation. 3. Multifocal central nodular opacities, with an area of consolidation in the left lower lobe lung is concerning for aspiration and/or multifocal pneumonia. Recommend attention on follow-up CT to confirm resolution. 4. Four-chamber cardiac enlargement with reflux of contrast into the hepatic veins may be seen with elevated right heart pressures in the right clinical setting. 5. Possible hepatic steatosis.

            "answer": "CTA CHEST FOR PE HISTORY: Pulmonary embolism suspected TECHNIQUE: CTA chest with intravenous contrast attention to pulmonary arteries. Sagittal, coronal and slab 3D MIP coronal reconstructed images were also created for further evaluation and interpretation. One of the following dose optimization techniques was utilized in the performance of this exam: Automated exposure control; adjustment of the mA and/or kV according to the patient's size; or use of an iterative reconstruction technique. Specific details can be referenced in the facility's radiology CT exam operational policy. CONTRAST: 75 mL Isovue-370 COMPARISON: None. FINDINGS: Examination is degraded by respiratory motion and suboptimal contrast bolus timing. Heart/vessels: No pulmonary embolus to the lobar level. Pulmonary trunk is mildly dilated at 3.3 cm. Three-vessel coronary artery calcifications. Mediastinum: Negative. Lymph nodes: Enlarged mediastinal right hilar lymph nodes. For example, a preaortic lymph node measures 11 mm in the short axis and a right hilar lymph node measures approximately 10 mm in the short axis. Lungs/pleura: Elevated right hemidiaphragm. Linear atelectasis/scarring at the lung bases, right more so than left. Mild pulmonary edema. Scattered subcentimeter pulmonary nodules, the largest is in the left lower lobe and measures 6 mm (4/193). No pleural effusion or pneumothorax. Central airways are patent. Visualized upper abdomen: Small left renal cyst. Bones/soft tissues: No acute osseous abnormality or suspicious osseous lesion. IMPRESSION: 1. No pulmonary embolus to the lobar level. 2. Mild pulmonary edema. 3. Nonspecific mediastinal and right hilar lymphadenopathy. 4. Scattered subcentimeter pulmonary nodules measuring up to 6 mm. 5. Other chronic/incidental findings as above. RECOMMENDATION Pulmonary nodule: Non-contrast chest CT at 3-6 months is recommended. If the nodules are stable at time of repeat CT, then future CT at 18-24 months (from today's scan) is considered optional for low-risk patients, but is recommended for high-risk patients (Per Fleischner Society guidelines).

            "answer": "CTA CHEST FOR PE EXAMINATION: CTA of the chest with IV contrast History : Syncope TECHNIQUE: Pulmonary embolus protocol - Thin-slice axial imaging of the chest was performed during maximal pulmonary arterial opacification with intravenous nonionic iodinated contrast. 3D coronal slab MIPs and 2D reconstructions in the coronal and sagittal planes were performed to aid in pulmonary embolus detection. Representative images have been stored on PACS. One of the following dose optimization techniques was utilized in the performance of this exam: Automated exposure control; adjustment of the mA and/or kV according to the patient's size; or use of an iterative reconstruction technique. Specific details can be referenced in the facility's radiology CT exam operational policy. Contrast: 100 cc of Isovue-370 COMPARISON STUDIES: 5/18/2023, CT scans dating back to 2021. FINDINGS: Please note that this exam is optimized for assessment of the pulmonary arteries and is not intended as a diagnostic study of the thoracic aorta, coronary arteries or venous structures. Angiographic Findings: Pulmonary arteries: There are no filling defects in the main, right, left, lobar, segmental or visualized sub-segmental branches of the pulmonary arterial system Other vasculature: Prominent calcification of the thoracic aorta and coronary vessels. The thoracic aorta is ectatic. Mid ascending thoracic aorta measures 3.3 cm. Distal aortic arch measures 3 cm. The upper abdominal aorta measures 3.2 cm.. Additional non-angiographic findings: Lungs / Pleura: Reidentified are numerous scattered pulmonary nodules many of which are cavitary. Biapical pleural scarring with some pleural calcification. When compared to recent prior CT 5/18/2023, the nodules are slightly enlarged some which are now cavitary. When compared to older CTs, these nodules have definitely progressed. Index nodules: 10 x 9 mm cavitary right upper lobe nodule (6/40), previously measured 11 x 7 mm 8 x 8mm cavitary right upper lobe nodule (6/113), previously measured 10 x 6 mm and was not cavitary. 19 x 8 mm cavitary right lower lobe nodule (6/191), previously measured 25 x 14 mm and was 2 discrete cavitary nodules. 9 x 9 mm cavitary left upper lobe nodule (6/175), previously measured 8 x 7 mm and was not cavitary. Mediastinum / Hila: negative. Heart / Pericardium: Atherosclerotic calcification. Lymph node assessment: negative Musculoskeletal / Body wall: Scoliosis with degenerative changes. Prior lumbar fusion Upper abdomen: Ectatic and mildly aneurysmal upper abdominal aorta measures 3.2 cm, stable IMPRESSION: 1. No evidence for pulmonary emboli the subsegmental level. 2. Scattered pulmonary nodules many of which are cavitary are slightly progressed when compared to CT 5/18/2023. The nodules have significantly progressed when compared to older CTs. Patient has seen pulmonary for evaluation of the nodules per EMR. Differential diagnosis includes infectious nodules (fungal/MAI) versus metastatic nodules. Further evaluation deferred to pulmonary.

No Was there a contrast or saline extravasation? No TECHNIQUE: Using multidetector CT, contrast enhanced chest CT was performed. Three-dimensional (MIP) reconstructions were performed. Three-dimensional coronal and sagittal MIP reconstructions were performed. All CT scans at this facility use dose modulation, iterative reconstruction, and/or weight based dosing when appropriate to reduce radiation dose to as low as reasonably achievable. CONTRAST: Isovue 370 60 mL COMPARISON: None FINDINGS: CTA: Contrast bolus timing allows for adequate evaluation to the level of the segmental pulmonary arteries. No filling defect to suggest pulmonary embolus. Main pulmonary artery measures 2.5 cm, however the right main pulmonary artery measures 3.3 cm in the left main pulmonary artery measures 2.8 cm which may be seen in setting of pulmonary hypertension. Thyroid: Visualized portions are unremarkable. Thoracic inlet: No supraclavicular adenopathy. Mediastinum and hila: No mediastinal or hilar adenopathy. Patulous upper esophagus with retained debris, probably gastroesophageal reflux versus dysmotility. Small hiatal hernia.. Heart and great vessels: The heart is normal in size. Lipomatous hypertrophy of the interatrial septum. Mild coronary artery calcifications. No pericardial effusion. Lungs, airway and pleura: Central airways are patent and normal in caliber. Bilateral bronchial wall thickening, probably inflammatory. Subcentimeter lung nodules, for example lingular subpleural nodule (6, 218), measuring 0.5 cm and left lower lobe nodule (6, 260), measuring 0.4 cm.. No focal consolidations. Bibasilar dependent atelectasis. Breast and axilla: No axillary adenopathy. Upper Abdomen: Visualized portions of the upper abdomen are unremarkable.

No Was there a contrast or saline extravasation? No. pt with recent trach; new vent requirement; rhonchi bilaterally IV contrast: 60 mL Isovue-370. Technique: Contiguous axial CTA images of the chest were performed after the administration of IV contrast. Post processed CTA MIP images of the pulmonary arteries were created and reviewed. The axial source images were also reviewed. IMMEDIATE ADVERSE EVENT: None Comparison: CTA chest dated 1/9/2024. Chest x-ray dated 1/13/2024. Findings: Redemonstrated tracheostomy cannula. Interval decrease in size of previously present small pericardial effusion. Mild to moderate coronary artery calcifications. The great vessels are unremarkable, with normal course and caliber. Borderline enlarged mediastinal and hilar lymph nodes, similar compared to prior. Soft tissue fullness in the left axilla with adjacent fat stranding, axial image 14 of series 5. The soft tissue lesion measures 2.7 x 2.8 cm similar to slightly decreased in size since prior study where it measured 2.9 x 3.0 cm. There are adjacent prominent left axillary lymph nodes, significantly decreased in size since prior study, which no longer meet size criteria for lymphadenopathy measuring up to 9 mm in short axis. Pulmonary artery caliber: 3.4 cm. No evidence of pulmonary emboli to the segmental levels. Bronchial wall thickening, more pronounced in the bilateral lower lobes. Multifocal lower lobe bronchial plugs, more pronounced in the right lower lobe. Interlobular septal thickening is noted along with groundglass opacities, most pronounced in the bilateral lower lobes, but also evident in the bilateral upper lobes. There is no pneumothorax. Trace right and small left pleural effusions. Visualized portions of the upper abdomen demonstrate splenomegaly. Small hiatal hernia. Chronic fracture of the sternum. Healing subacute fractures of the anterior right third through sixth ribs and anterior left second through seventh ribs. The collection of findings is likely related to prior resuscitation. IMPRESSION: No CT evidence of pulmonary emboli to the segmental levels. Bronchial wall thickening more pronounced in the bilateral lower lobes with multifocal lower lobe bronchial plugs, more pronounced on the right. Findings are consistent with airways disease. Interlobular septal thickening and groundglass opacities in both lungs, most pronounced in the bilateral lower lobes. Findings may represent pulmonary edema, improved since prior, or atypical infection. Improving bilateral pleural effusions, now trace right and small left. Interval decrease in size of previously present small pericardial effusion. Left axilla soft tissue mass and associated left axillary lymphadenopathy have decreased since prior study. The mass now measures 2.7 x 2.8 cm, previously 2.9 x 3.0 cm. It has increased in size since 4/11/2023 where it measured 1.5 x 2.0 cm. The mass is of unclear etiology, however given presence of splenomegaly a lymphoproliferative process cannot be excluded, other etiologies. Correlate with history. Consider biopsy, if clinically indicated. Healing subacute fractures of the sternum and bilateral ribs, likely related to prior resuscitation.

TECHNIQUE: Contiguous helical images were performed through the thorax without contrast. Two additional series of noncontiguous high resolution thin axial images were obtained in the prone in end inspiration and supine position in end expiration. Noncontiguous high resolution end-inspiratory images were reconstructed from the helical data set. COMPARISON: CTA chest for PE 7/14/2023. CT chest ILD 1/9/2023. FINDINGS: Thyroid: Visualized portions are normal. Thoracic inlet: No supraclavicular lymphadenopathy. Mediastinum and hila: No mediastinal or hilar lymphadenopathy. Similar patulous esophagus and moderate sized hiatal hernia. Heart and great vessels: Normal size of the heart. Severe coronary calcifications. Mitral annular calcifications. No significant pericardial effusion. Similar borderline elevated enlargement of the ascending thoracic aorta to 4.0 cm. Also, similar enlargement of the main pulmonary artery to 3.4 cm, which may be seen with pulmonary hypertension. Airways, Pleural, and HRCT Lung Findings: Central airways are clear. Similar bronchial wall thickening and advanced upper lobe predominant centrilobular emphysema, with hyperinflation. Unchanged punctate 0.3 cm nodule in the left lower lobe lung (8/176). No new pulmonary nodule. No significant groundglass abnormality. No pleural effusion. Similar reticular abnormality at the right greater than left lung bases (3/62). Also, there is a similar small area of honeycombing in the medial basilar segment of the right lower lobe (3/62). No definite traction bronchiectasis. Suboptimal expiration, however, there is likely diffuse bilateral air trapping in keeping with COPD. Breast and axilla: Redemonstrated right greater than left gynecomastia, increased on the right, better assessed by prior breast imaging. No axillary lymphadenopathy. Upper abdomen: Left upper quadrant colonic diverticulosis without evidence of diverticulitis. Bones and Soft Tissues: There is mild degenerative change of the spine. No aggressive osseous lesion. Superficial soft tissues are within normal limits. IMPRESSION: 1. In comparison to 1/9/2023 exam unchanged basilar predominant interstitial lung disease with honeycombing in keeping with UIP pattern and advanced smoking related changes. 2. Unchanged mild enlargement of the ascending thoracic aorta and main pulmonary artery.

No Was there a contrast or saline extravasation? No TECHNIQUE: Using multidetector CT, contrast enhanced chest CT was performed with contrast in pulmonary arterial phase. Three-dimensional (MIP) reconstructions were performed. Three-dimensional coronal and sagittal MIP reconstructions were performed. CONTRAST: Isovue 370 75 mL COMPARISON: None FINDINGS: CTA: Contrast bolus timing allows for adequate evaluation to the level of the segmental pulmonary arteries. No filling defect to suggest pulmonary embolus. No findings to suggest right heart strain. Thyroid: Visualized portions are normal. Thoracic inlet: No supraclavicular lymphadenopathy. Mediastinum and hila: No mediastinal or hilar lymphadenopathy. Small hiatal hernia. Heart and great vessels: Normal heart size. Normal pericardium. Thoracic aorta normal in caliber with mild atherosclerotic disease. Main pulmonary artery measures up to 3.4 cm, which may suggest pulmonary hypertension. Moderate primarily LAD coronary artery calcifications. Lungs, airway and pleura: Expiratory imaging and respiratory motion degrade evaluation. No focal consolidation. Mild bibasilar atelectasis or scarring. Large superior segment right lower lobe nodule measuring 11 x 15 mm (series 3, image 59). There are additional scattered pulmonary nodules throughout all 5 lung lobes, some of them micronodular in appearance with others measuring up to 5 mm. Subtle suggestive of tree-in-bud and clustered nodularity within bilateral lower lobes, notably the superior segment, nonspecific. No pleural effusion or pneumothorax. Breast and axilla: Bilateral retroareolar soft tissue densities, on the left measuring 16 x 11 mm (series 4, image 244, on the right measuring 10 x 13 mm (series 4, image 250). No axillary lymphadenopathy. Upper abdomen: Heterogeneous attenuation of the spleen, likely secondary arterial phase of enhancement. Normal adrenals. No acute abdominal abnormality. Bones and Soft Tissues: There is mild degenerative change of the spine. No aggressive osseous lesion. Superficial soft tissues are within normal limits. IMPRESSION: 1. Negative for acute pulmonary embolism. 2. Mild bronchial wall thickening with subtle tree-in-bud and clustered nodularity within bilateral lower lobes, nonspecific, possibly suggesting aspiration. 3. Superimposed right lower lobe nodule measuring 11 x 15 mm with with additional nodules throughout all 5 lung lobes measuring up to 5 mm. Given appearance, recommend further follow-up via PET/CT, tissue biopsy of right lower lobe nodule, or follow-up CT in 3 months, as findings may all be infectious or inflammatory in nature; however, pulmonary malignancy with intrapulmonary metastatic disease is not excluded. No definitive mediastinal or hilar adenopathy. 4. Somewhat hyperenhancing bilateral retroareolar soft tissue densities, mildly larger on the left measuring 16 x 11 mm. While this may be benign breast tissue, given appearance with pulmonary findings, recommend correlation with mammogram history. No axillary adenopathy. 5. Small hiatal hernia. 6. Main pulmonary artery measures up to 3.4 cm, which may represent pulmonary hypertension.

            "answer": "CTA CHEST FOR PE DATE OF EXAM: 02/25/2024, 1428 INDICATION: . Pulmonary embolism (PE) suspected, positive D-dimer Was there a contrast reaction? No Was there a contrast or saline extravasation? No TECHNIQUE: Using multidetector CT, contrast enhanced chest CT was performed with contrast in pulmonary arterial phase. Three-dimensional (MIP) reconstructions were performed. Three-dimensional coronal and sagittal MIP reconstructions were performed. CONTRAST: Isovue 370 40 mL COMPARISON: CT PE 2/18/2018 FINDINGS: CTA: Excellent opacification of the pulmonary arterial tree without filling defect to suggest acute or chronic pulmonary embolism. Thyroid: Visualized portions are normal. Thoracic inlet: No supraclavicular lymphadenopathy. Mediastinum and hila: No mediastinal or hilar lymphadenopathy. Small hiatal hernia with postsurgical changes of the GE junction, stable. Heart and great vessels: Normal size of the heart. No significant pericardial effusion. Normal size of the great vessels. Mild aortic valve/annular calcifications. Mild atherosclerotic thoracic aorta. Moderate multivessel coronary artery calcifications, notably LAD. Lungs, airway and pleura: Mucoid debris dependently within the upper trachea. Mild diffuse bronchial wall thickening with areas of distal mucoid debris notably of the lingula, lateral right middle lobe and right lower lobe. Severe centrilobular and paraseptal emphysema with basilar predominant bullous changes, with mild progression from prior study from 2018. Mild biapical scarring. Minimal nodularity paramediastinal right upper lobe, likely atelectasis or scarring. Mass suspicious nodules. No pleural effusion or pneumothorax. Breast and axilla: No axillary lymphadenopathy. Upper abdomen: Multiple ill-defined calcific densities regional to the duodenum/common bile duct, stable. No definitive acute abdominal abnormality. Simple appearing left renal cyst. Bones and Soft Tissues: Generalized osteopenia. Age-indeterminate compression deformity T4 vertebral body with 50% height loss centrally. Additional age-indeterminate compression deformity along the posterior and inferior aspect of the T11 vertebral body with small osseous fragment noted at the T11/T12 intervertebral disc space posteriorly. No high-grade canal stenosis. No significant height loss. No focal soft tissue abnormality. IMPRESSION: 1. Negative for acute or chronic pulmonary embolism. 2. Mucoid debris within the upper central airways with superimposed moderate diffuse bronchial wall thickening and peripheral mucoid debris, all nonspecific, possibly underlying asthma or bronchitis. 3. Severe emphysema with bullous change, progressed since prior study from 2018. 4. Age-indeterminate compression deformities of the T4 vertebral body with approximately 50% height loss centrally. Additional age-indeterminate compression deformity of the posterior inferior T11 vertebral body without significant height loss. 5. Small hiatal hernia with stable postsurgical changes of the GE junction. CONTACT INFORMATION: This exam was interpreted by a University of Colorado School of Medicine radiology physician.

Specific details can be referenced in the facility's radiology CT exam operational policy. CONTRAST: 80 mL of Isovue-370. COMPARISON: 4/19/2020. FINDINGS: This study is suboptimal because of metal artifact from thoracic spine hardware. This artifact as well as suboptimal contrast enhancement of the pulmonary arteries limits the evaluation. Heart/vessels: Cardiomegaly. No abnormal dilatation of the main pulmonary artery or evidence of right heart strain. No pulmonary emboli are seen. Normal caliber aorta without evidence of dissection. Mediastinum: Small hiatal hernia. Lymph nodes: 1.1 cm subcarinal lymph node no significant change. Lungs/pleura: Pleural and parenchymal scarring within the lateral right lower lobe has not significantly changed. Stable parenchymal scarring within the lingula. No acute infiltrate, CHF or pleural effusion. Visualized upper abdomen: 0.6 cm hypodense lesion within segment eight of the liver. This is not appreciated on the prior study although that could be because of artifact in that region. 1.3 cm ill-defined hypodense lesion within segment six does not represent a simple cyst. It may represent a hemangioma. Bones/soft tissues: Stable postsurgical changes within the visible spine. IMPRESSION: 1. Limited exam. No pulmonary emboli identified. No acute abnormality of the chest. Stable pleural and parenchymal scarring within the right lower lobe and lingula. 2. Stable 1.1 cm subcarinal lymph node. 3. Two hypodense liver lesions.

Three-dimensional (MIP) reconstructions were performed. Three-dimensional coronal and sagittal MIP reconstructions were performed. CONTRAST: Isovue 370 80 mL COMPARISON: None FINDINGS: CTA: Contrast bolus timing allows for adequate evaluation to the level of the segmental pulmonary arteries. No filling defect to suggest pulmonary embolus. No findings to suggest right heart strain. Thyroid: Visualized portions are normal. Thoracic inlet: No supraclavicular lymphadenopathy. Mediastinum and hila: A right hilar lymph node is seen measuring 1.1 cm in short axis (5/122). Additional prominent bilateral hilar lymph nodes. No significant mediastinal adenopathy. Small hiatal hernia. Heart and great vessels: Normal size of the heart. No significant pericardial effusion. Normal size of the great vessels. Lungs, airway and pleura: The central airways are patent. Mild peribronchial thickening. Extensive tree in bud nodularity is seen at the lung bases bilaterally (6/191). There are superimposed areas of groundglass/consolidation, particularly in the anterior medial segment of the left lower lobe lung (6/213). In the lateral basal segment of the left lower lobe lung there are two adjacent nodules, with the larger measuring 0.8 x 0.7 cm (6/256). No pleural effusion or pneumothorax. Breast and axilla: Visualized breast tissue is symmetric. No axillary lymphadenopathy. Upper abdomen: Visualized portions of the upper abdomen are unremarkable.

Was there a contrast reaction? No Was there a contrast or saline extravasation? No . COMPARISON: CT PE 1/8/2024. TECHNIQUE: Contrast enhanced chest CT performed during the injection of 70 mL of Isovue-370 according to PE protocol. Three-dimensional (MIP) reconstructions were performed. FINDINGS: CTA FINDINGS: Contrast bolus timing is adequate to rule out pulmonary embolus through the segmental pulmonary arteries. Main pulmonary artery is normal in caliber. No filling defects. OTHER FINDINGS: Thyroid: Mildly enlarged without discrete nodularity. Thoracic inlet: No supraclavicular lymphadenopathy. Heart and great vessels: Mild cardiomegaly. Atherosclerotic calcifications of the left anterior descending coronary artery. The thoracic aorta is normal in caliber. Mild atherosclerotic calcifications of the aorta and its branches. Mediastinum and hila: Calcified mediastinal and hilar lymph nodes, likely sequelae of prior granulomatous process. Stable mild mediastinal lymphadenopathy, minimally increased from prior study. For example, a precarinal node measures 1.0 cm. Similar patulous esophagus with mild wall thickening. Small hiatal hernia. Lungs, airways, and pleura: The central airways are patent. Mild bronchial wall thickening, again with scattered mucous impaction of the distal airways. Redemonstrated bilateral traction bronchiectasis, interlobular septal thickening, and reticulation within upper lobe predominance. Mildly increased geographic groundglass opacities. Unchanged 4 mm nodule in the left upper lobe (series 6/image 108). Scattered calcified granulomata. No pleural effusion. No pneumothorax. Chest wall and axillae: No axillary lymphadenopathy. Upper abdomen: Timing of contrast bolus limits evaluation of the upper abdominal solid organs and bowel. Splenic parenchymal calcified granulomas. Unchanged simple hepatic cysts and hepatic parenchymal calcified granulomas. Unchanged left adrenal nodule measuring 1.7 x 1.6 cm (series 8/image 139), unchanged dating back to at least 5/22/2022, and therefore likely benign. Bones: Diffusely demineralized bones. Mild thoracic levocurvature. Moderate degenerative changes of the spine. No acute osseous findings. IMPRESSION: 1. No pulmonary embolus. 2. Mildly increased patchy bilateral groundglass pulmonary opacities, which may reflect atypical/viral infection versus exacerbation of known underlying interstitial lung disease. 3. Stable mild mediastinal lymphadenopathy. ________________________________________________ This exam was interpreted by a University of Colorado School of Medicine radiology physician.

            "answer": "EXAMINATION: CTA CHEST FOR PE DATE: 02/16/2024, 2228 INDICATION: Pulmonary embolism (PE) suspected. Shortness of breath and hypoxia. Was there a contrast reaction? No Was there a contrast or saline extravasation? No . COMPARISON: Same day chest radiograph. TECHNIQUE: Contrast enhanced chest CT performed during the injection of 50 mL of Isovue-370 according to PE protocol. Three-dimensional (MIP) reconstructions were performed. FINDINGS: CTA FINDINGS: Contrast bolus timing is adequate to rule out pulmonary embolus to the segmental pulmonary arteries. Dilated of the main pulmonary artery, measuring up to 4.0 cm in caliber No filling defects. OTHER FINDINGS: Thyroid: No nodularity. Thoracic inlet: No supraclavicular lymphadenopathy. Heart and great vessels: Borderline cardiomegaly. Ectasia of the ascending aorta, measuring up to 4.3 cm in caliber (measured on 902/150). Mediastinum and hila: Mediastinal and hilar lymphadenopathy, for example right pretracheal lymph node measuring 1.5 cm short axis (5/34). Enlarged right hilar lymph node measures 1.2 cm short axis (5/43). Enlarged infracarinal lymph nodes measuring up to 1.3 cm in maximal thickness. Patulous esophagus. Lungs, airways, and pleura: Suggestion of paraseptal emphysema. Secretions in the mid trachea (for example, as seen on series 6/image 84). Opacification of multiple distal airways bilaterally, with a dependent predominance. Diffuse bronchial wall thickening. Tree-in-bud nodularity in the peripheral right upper lobe 6/146). Small airspace opacity within the posterior right upper lobe, along the right major fissure (904/95) Faint groundglass opacities and questionable peribronchial vascular nodules in the bilateral lower lobes. Mild dependent atelectasis bilaterally. Pleural-based triangular pulmonary nodule in the anterior right upper lobe almost certainly reflects a pleural lymph node (6/139) or may represent sequela of infectious process. No pleural effusion. No pneumothorax. Chest wall and axillae: Mild right-sided gynecomastia. Upper abdomen: Timing of contrast bolus limits evaluation of the upper abdominal solid organs and bowel. Simple cyst in the right hepatic lobe. Partially visualized colonic diverticulosis. Bones and soft tissues: Moderate degenerative changes of the imaged spine. Sclerotic focus in the left lateral fourth rib (6/165) and lytic focus in the left lateral sixth rib (902/144). Diastasis recti. Mild right gynecomastia. IMPRESSION: 1. No pulmonary embolus. 2. Diffuse bronchial wall thickening, secretions in the trachea, opacification of multiple bilateral distal airways, tree-in-bud nodularity in the peripheral right upper lobe along with associated consolidative airspace opacity. Findings concerning for aspiration pneumonia, airways disease or atypical infection. 3. Paraseptal emphysema with dilation of the main pulmonary artery, suggestive of chronic pulmonary arterial hypertension. 4. Ectasia of the ascending thoracic aorta measuring up to 4.3 cm in caliber. 5. Mediastinal and hilar lymphadenopathy, likely reactive. 6. Sclerotic focus in the left lateral fourth rib, favored to represent a bone island. 7. Nonspecific subcentimeter lytic focus in the left lateral sixth rib, indeterminate. Cannot exclude multiple myeloma or metastatic disease in the appropriate clinical setting. Correlate with prior imaging, if available, to assess for stability. Otherwise, attention on follow-up. ________________________________________________ This exam was interpreted by a University of Colorado School of Medicine radiology physician.

            "answer": "CTA CHEST FOR PE HISTORY: Hx osteochroma, L 1st rib, s/p resection suggestion of possible tiny right subclavian artery/vein fistula on a prior CT from 2021. New medial left costal pain. TECHNIQUE: CTA chest with intravenous contrast attention to pulmonary arteries. Sagittal, coronal and slab 3D MIP coronal reconstructed images were also created for further evaluation and interpretation. One of the following dose optimization techniques was utilized in the performance of this exam: Automated exposure control; adjustment of the mA and/or kV according to the patient's size; or use of an iterative reconstruction technique. Specific details can be referenced in the facility's radiology CT exam operational policy. CONTRAST: 50 mL Isovue-370 COMPARISON: Reports, but no imaging, from a CTA on September 24, 2021 suggesting a possible tiny right subclavian artery and vein AV fistula. FINDINGS: Pulmonary arteries: No pulmonary embolism identified. Heart/vessels: Negative. Mediastinum: Negative. Lymph nodes: Negative. Lungs/pleura: Negative. Visualized upper abdomen: Negative. Bones/soft tissues: There has been resection of the anterior left first rib. IMPRESSION: 1. Postoperative changes of resection of the anterior left first rib. No new lesions identified. 2. No definite evidence of AV fistula involving the right subclavian artery, although CT angiogram would be more sensitive. Would consider obtaining the original images from the 2021 CTA which suggested this finding for comparison before pursuing additional imaging.

            "answer": "CTA CHEST FOR PE HISTORY: 2 days of cough, congestion, shortness of breath, and chest pressure. Elevated d-dimer. COMPARISON: None. TECHNIQUE: Pulmonary embolus protocol: Thin-slice axial imaging of the chest was performed during maximal pulmonary arterial opacification with intravenous nonionic iodinated contrast. Sagittal and coronal reformats and axial, sagittal, and coronal MIP series were performed to aid in pulmonary embolus detection. One of the following dose optimization techniques was utilized in the performance of this exam: Automated exposure control; adjustment of the mA and/or kV according to the patient's size; or use of an iterative reconstruction technique. Specific details can be referenced in the facility's radiology CT exam operational policy. CONTRAST: 70 mL of IV Isovue-370. FINDINGS: PULMONARY ARTERIES: The pulmonary trunk is normal in caliber. Pulmonary arteries are adequately opacified to the suboptimal although adequate pulmonary artery opacification to the subsegmental level. Respiratory motion limits evaluation. No central pulmonary embolism. No segmental or subsegmental pulmonary embolism within the limits of the examination. THORACIC INLET: Normal. AORTA AND ARCH BRANCH VESSELS: No aneurysm or dissection. There is no atherosclerosis of the aorta. HEART/PERICARDIUM: The heart is normal. There is no pericardial effusion. There is no coronary artery calcification. MEDIASTINUM/HILA: Small mediastinal lymph nodes. Enlarged right hilar lymph node, which measures 1.1 cm in cross-section (image 60 series 2). LUNGS/PLEURA: No pleural effusion. Mild atelectasis. No pneumothorax. Bronchial thickening, greatest in the right lower lobe, where there is segmental bronchiole opacification. UPPER ABDOMEN: Liver measures less than 40 Hounsfield units, in keeping with hepatic steatosis. There is focal fatty sparing at the gallbladder fossa. Patent portal vein. Bilateral nonobstructing renal calculi. MUSCULOSKELETAL/VERTEBRA/BODY WALL: No acute abnormality. Tiny sclerotic lesion within the anterior T8 vertebra is most likely a benign bone island. IMPRESSION: 1. No central pulmonary embolism and no segmental or subsegmental pulmonary embolism within the limits of the examination. 2. Bronchial thickening, which may be due to bronchitis. 3. Enlarged right hilar lymph node is likely reactive. 4. Hepatic steatosis (fatty liver), which can lead to steatohepatitis and eventual cirrhosis. 5. Bilateral nonobstructing renal calculi.

No Was there a contrast or saline extravasation? No TECHNIQUE: Using multidetector CT, contrast enhanced chest CT was performed. Three-dimensional (MIP) reconstructions were performed. Three-dimensional coronal and sagittal MIP reconstructions were performed. All CT scans at this facility use dose modulation, iterative reconstruction, and/or weight based dosing when appropriate to reduce radiation dose to as low as reasonably achievable. CONTRAST: Isovue 370 50 mL COMPARISON: None FINDINGS: CTA: Contrast bolus timing allows for adequate evaluation to the level of the segmental pulmonary arteries. No filling defect to suggest pulmonary embolus. Borderline main pulmonary artery measuring 3.2 cm Thyroid: Visualized portions are unremarkable. Thoracic inlet: No supraclavicular adenopathy. Mediastinum and hila: No mediastinal or hilar adenopathy. Partially calcified right hilar lymph nodes, probably sequela of prior granulomatous process. Mildly patulous mid and distal esophagus. Heart and great vessels: Heart is normal in size. No pericardial effusion. Normal caliber thoracic aorta. Lungs, airway and pleura: Central airways are patent and normal in caliber. No focal consolidation, pleural effusion, or pneumothorax. Mild bibasilar mosaic attenuation pattern of the lung, probably related to air trapping. No suspicious pulmonary nodule.

Chest radiograph dated 2/3/2024 FINDINGS: PULMONARY CTA FINDINGS: This is a diagnostic quality helical CT pulmonary angiogram. There is no acute pulmonary embolism to the first subsegmental pulmonary artery level. OTHER FINDINGS: Support Devices: None. Heart/Pericardium/Great Vessels: Cardiac size is normal. There is moderate calcific coronary artery atherosclerosis. There is no pericardial effusion. There is mild thoracic aortic and branch vessel atherosclerosis, portions calcific. The main pulmonary artery is normal in diameter. Pleural Spaces: The pleural spaces are clear. Mediastinum/Hila: There is no mediastinal or hilar lymph node enlargement. Neck Base/Chest Wall/Diaphragm/Upper Abdomen: There is no supraclavicular or axillary lymph node enlargement. Limited imaging through the upper abdomen demonstrates unchanged scattered intrahepatic cysts measuring up to 3.7 cm in the posterior right hepatic lobe. Mild degenerative change is present in the spine. There is questioned subacute or healed left anterolateral third through fifth rib fractures. Lungs/Central Airways: The trachea is clear. There is bronchial wall thickening of the right lung associated with a right upper lobe consolidation and consolidation since centrilobular groundglass opacities in the right lower lobe. A small amount of loculated pleural air in the left anterior pleura measures up to 4.9 x 0.8 cm and has slightly increased compared to the prior CT. Linear opacities in the left lower lobe are not significantly changed and are favored to represent subsegmental atelectasis. IMPRESSION: 1. No evidence of acute pulmonary embolism to the first subsegmental level. 2. New consolidations involving the right upper and lower lobes suggestive of pneumonia. Follow-up imaging in 4-6 weeks is recommended to assess resolution. 3. Slightly increased small loculated pleural air in the left anterior pleura since 2/1/2024.

CONTRAST: Isovue 370 100 mL COMPARISON: CT PE 2/20/2024 FINDINGS: CTA: Contrast bolus timing allows for adequate evaluation to the level of the distal segmental pulmonary arteries. No filling defect to suggest pulmonary embolus. Thyroid: Visualized portions are normal. Thoracic inlet: No supraclavicular lymphadenopathy. Mediastinum and hila: There is mild overall worsening of mediastinal and ill-defined right hilar adenopathy, with multiple mildly enlarged AP window and prevascular lymph nodes, enlarged subcarinal lymph node, ill-defined right hilar adenopathy, all increased since prior. Heart and great vessels: Normal heart size. No significant pericardial effusion or thickening. Thoracic aorta main pulmonary artery normal in caliber. No coronary artery calcifications. Lungs, airway and pleura: Central airways are patent. There is worsening aeration compared with 2/20/2024, with dense right upper and right middle lobe consolidation with underlying air bronchograms. There are additional patchy groundglass opacities present throughout. Background smooth interlobular septal thickening. Moderate right-sided and small left-sided pleural effusions, increased since prior. Subtle enhancement of the basilar pleura within the areas of effusion. Bibasilar passive atelectasis is noted. No pneumothorax bilaterally. Breast and axilla: Mild increase in left greater than right axillary adenopathy, likely reactive. Upper abdomen: Diffuse hepatic steatosis with likely underlying hepatomegaly, stable. Trace perisplenic and perihepatic ascites, mildly increased since prior. Bones and Soft Tissues: No acute bony abnormality. IMPRESSION: 1. Negative for PE. 2. Significant worsening of aeration compared with 2/20/2024, now with dense right upper and right middle lobe consolidation with additional consolidative and groundglass opacities throughout. Findings suggest acute multilobar pneumonia. 3. Superimposed pulmonary edema with moderate right-sided and small left-sided pleural effusions. There is subtle enhancement of the basilar pleura within the areas of effusion. These findings may suggest superimposed pleuritis, given history of lupus. 4. Mild interval increase in mediastinal and right greater than left hilar adenopathy, as well as increased axillary adenopathy, all favored to be reactive in nature. Attention on follow-up. 5. Diffuse hepatic steatosis. Mild perihepatic and perisplenic ascites, increased since prior. 6. Of note, given history of lupus, no sizable pericardial effusion or enhancement to suggest pericarditis.

            "answer": "CTA CHEST FOR PE GIVEN HISTORY: Pulmonary embolism (PE) suspected, unknown D-dimer COMPARISON: Chest x-ray from earlier today. TECHNIQUE: Helical CT imaging of the chest was performed with 75 mL of IV Isovue-370. Multiplanar and MIP reconstructions were provided. All CT scans at this location are performed using dose modulation techniques as appropriate to a performed exam including the following: Automated exposure control; adjustment of the mA and/or kV according to patient size (this includes techniques or standardized protocols for targeted exams where dose is matched to indication / reason for exam; i.e., extremities or head); use of iterative reconstruction technique. DOSE: CTDIvol: 16.4 mGy DLP: 613 mGy-cm PROBLEM-SPECIFIC FINDINGS: PULMONARY VASCULATURE: Patent. LUNGS: The chest is clear. There are no suspicious opacities or pulmonary nodules. The ill-defined nodular opacities on the earlier chest x-ray are related to vascular crowding, largely secondary to portable chest x-ray technique. PLEURA: No effusions or pleural plaques. ADDITIONAL FINDINGS: CHEST AIRWAYS: Patent. MEDIASTINUM: There are no pericardial effusions or any mediastinal adenopathy. Prominence of the ascending thoracic aorta measures up to 5 cm (see coronal series 7 image 148 and axial series 6 image 93) there is also prominence of the main pulmonary artery, though it is obliqued and most planes. HILA: Normal. No adenopathy. UPPER ABDOMEN: Small low-attenuation lesions are seen in both kidneys and are not not well evaluated on this exam. The upper abdomen is otherwise normal. BONES: No aggressive lytic or blastic lesions. Degenerative changes of the spine are noted. LOWER NECK: The lower neck soft tissues are normal. SKIN/SOFT TISSUES: The skin and superficial soft tissues are normal. IMPRESSION: 1. The pulmonary vasculature is patent. There are no pulmonary emboli. 2. The chest is clear. 3. Prominence/ectasia of the ascending thoracic aorta measuring just under 5 cm in greatest dimension. Cardiology follow-up on an outpatient basis is recommended. 4. Prominence of the main pulmonary artery is nonspecific but can be seen in the setting of pulmonary arterial hypertension. Cardiology and/or pulmonology follow-up on an outpatient basis is recommended. 5. Small low-attenuation lesions in both kidneys are incompletely evaluated. Dedicated renal ultrasound on an outpatient basis is recommended. Report E-Signed By: Bennett Davis, MD at 2/4/2024 9:45 AM WSN:GVM1PACSDR01",

Sagittal, and coronal reformats were created by the technologist. Post-processed, reconstructed multiplanar reformatted MIP images of the chest were also provided. All CT scans at this facility use dose modulation, iterative reconstruction, and/or weight based dosing when appropriate to reduce radiation dose to as low as reasonably achievable. FINDINGS: Mediastinum:Normal appearance of the thyroid. Multiple prominent and enlarged lymph nodes are seen throughout the mediastinum and bilateral hila. The largest mediastinal hilar lymph node measures up to 1.2 cm in short axis in the right hilum. Opacification of the pulmonary arteries is appropriate for evaluation of pulmonary embolus on this exam. No pulmonary arterial filling defects are seen to suggest pulmonary embolus. The pulmonary arteries and thoracic aorta are normal in course and caliber. Upper limits of normal cardiac size. Densely calcified atherosclerotic plaque deposition is seen in the distribution of the left main, LAD, circumflex and right coronary arteries. Normal appearance of the esophagus. Lungs and pleura: Trace bilateral pleural effusions. Paraseptal emphysematous changes are again seen throughout the lungs, most significant in the lung apices. No pneumothorax. Diffuse bronchial wall thickening is seen throughout the lungs, most significant in the perihilar regions and bilateral lower lobes. Redemonstration of a 0.6 cm noncalcified pulmonary nodule along the peripheral inferior lateral left lower lobe (image 3:15, series 3) which is similar in size and appearance compared with prior imaging dating back to 2/16/2018 allowing for differences in/selection and measurement technique between exams. There is also redemonstration of a 0.6 cm pleural-based nodule along the periphery of the right middle lobe (image 303, series 3) which is also stable compared with the 2/16/2018 exam. Mild pulmonary edema is seen in the mid and lower lungs. Normal appearance of the trachea and mainstem bronchi. Chest wall: No axillary lymphadenopathy. Subacute appearing single site fracture of the anterolateral right fourth rib with calcifying callus formation is seen surrounding fracture lines. Acute appearing single site fracture is seen at the anterolateral right third rib. Upper abdomen: Visualized portions of the upper abdomen are unremarkable. IMPRESSION: 1. No pulmonary embolus is seen. 2. Trace bilateral pleural effusions and mild pulmonary edema in the mid and lower lungs. 3. Diffuse bronchial wall thickening is seen throughout the lungs, most significant in the perihilar regions and bilateral lower lobes. Correlate for clinical signs or symptoms of bronchitis. 4. Coronary artery disease as above. 5. Acute appearing single site fracture is seen at the anterolateral right third rib. Subacute appearing single site fracture of the anterolateral right fourth rib with calcifying callus formation is seen surrounding fracture lines. 6. Redemonstration of a 0.6 cm noncalcified pulmonary nodule along the peripheral inferior lateral left lower lobe and a 0.6 cm pleural-based nodule along the periphery of the right middle lobe which are similar in size and appearance compared with prior imaging dating back to 2/16/2018 allowing for differences in/selection and measurement technique between exams. 7.

TECHNICAL DATA: Following dynamic intravenous nonionic contrast infusion, multiple axial helical overlapped CT images with multiplanar reconstructions were obtained. All CT data was transferred to a 3D workstation for multiplanar reformation and 3D reconstruction under concurrent physician supervision. All CT scans at this facility use dose modulation, iterative reconstruction, and/or weight based dosing when appropriate to reduce radiation dose to as low as reasonably achievable. COMPARISONS: None available FINDINGS: Thoracic inlet: No focal lesion in the visualized thyroid gland. No supraclavicular lymphadenopathy Mediastinum: No significant mediastinal or hilar adenopathy. Thoracic aorta: Limited opacification. No aneurysm. Pulmonary arteries: Nondilated. No pulmonary emboli. Heart: Heart size normal. No pericardial effusion. Upper abdomen: No free air or other acute abnormality. Lungs/Pleura: Tracheobronchial tree patent. No infiltrate, consolidation, or nodule. Musculoskeletal: Spondylosis thoracic spine. No compression fracture or osseous lesion. Soft tissues: Soft tissues unremarkable. IMPRESSION: Negative for pulmonary embolism. No acute process. Spondylosis thoracic spine.

Representative images have been stored on PACS. One of the following dose optimization techniques was utilized in the performance of this exam: Automated exposure control; adjustment of the mA and/or kV according to the patient's size; or use of an iterative reconstruction technique. Specific details can be referenced in the facility's radiology CT exam operational policy. CONTRAST: 80 mL of IV Isovue-370. COMPARISON: Chest radiograph 5/9/2023 FINDINGS: CTA CHEST: Please note that this exam is optimized for assessment of the pulmonary arteries and is not intended as a diagnostic study of the thoracic aorta, coronary arteries or venous structures. Angiographic Findings: Pulmonary arteries: Images are degraded by suboptimal contrast bolus timing and respiratory motion. Within these confines, there are no convincing filling defects in the main, right, left, lobar or visualized segmental branches of the pulmonary arterial system.

CT chest performed 10/22/2021 and 4/12/2022. TECHNICAL DATA: Helical CT data through the chest after the uneventful intravenous administration of 75 ml of Isovue 370. Sagittal, and coronal reformats were created by the technologist. Post-processed, reconstructed multiplanar reformatted MIP images of the chest were also provided. All CT scans at this facility use dose modulation, iterative reconstruction, and/or weight based dosing when appropriate to reduce radiation dose to as low as reasonably achievable. FINDINGS: Mediastinum:Normal appearance of the thyroid. No mediastinal or hilar lymphadenopathy. . Opacification of the pulmonary arteries is appropriate for evaluation of pulmonary embolus on this exam. No pulmonary arterial filling defects are seen to suggest pulmonary embolus. The pulmonary arteries and thoracic aorta are normal in course and caliber. Normal heart size. Normal appearance of the esophagus.. Lungs and pleura: No dense areas of consolidation are seen throughout the lungs. No pneumothorax or pleural effusions are seen. Areas of atelectasis are seen scattered throughout the dependent portions of the lungs. Questionable mild pulmonary edema. There is a 0.8 cm noncalcified pulmonary nodule seen in the superior right middle lobe (image 167, series 6) which corresponds to the nodule seen on chest x-ray from the same day. This finding is unchanged compared with prior imaging dating back to 10/22/2021. No other pulmonary nodules are identified. Normal appearance of the trachea and mainstem bronchi. Chest wall: No axillary lymphadenopathy. Normal appearance of the musculature of the chest wall. No soft tissue masses. Bones: No acute or suspicious osseous findings. Upper abdomen: Visualized portions of the upper abdomen are unremarkable. IMPRESSION: 1. No pulmonary embolus or other acute cardiopulmonary findings are seen. 2. Questionable mild pulmonary edema. 3. Stable 0.8 cm noncalcified pulmonary nodule in the right middle lobe dating back to 10/22/2021.

CTA chest for PE 12/13/2015 INDICATION: Pulmonary nodule follow-up. TECHNIQUE: Noncontrast chest CT performed. All CT scans at this facility use dose modulation, iterative reconstruction, and/or weight based dosing when appropriate to reduce radiation dose to as low as reasonably achievable. FINDINGS: CHEST: HEART AND PERICARDIUM: The ascending aorta measuring up to 4.0 cm in maximal axial diameter. The blood pool is hypoattenuating to the adjacent myocardium, suggesting an element of anemia. The size of the heart itself is within normal limits. No significant pericardial fluid identified. Calcified atherosclerotic plaque is identified in the thoracic aorta, its arch branch vessels and the coronary vessels. MEDIASTINUM AND HILA: There is no significant mediastinal or hilar lymphadenopathy within the limitations of noncontrast technique. LUNGS AND PLEURA: There is a stable 1.2 x 1.0 cm somewhat spiculated pulmonary nodule within the posterior aspect of the left lower lobe (series 4, image 255; series 6, image 64). This measured 1.3 x 1.0 cm on the CT dated 9/4/2023. When reviewing the prior CTA chest dated 12/13/2015, this area was obscured from a pleural effusion. There are scattered stable pulmonary micronodules. No cavitary lesion is identified. Dependent changes are present. Bibasilar subsegmental atelectasis. No evidence of a pneumothorax. Support pleural effusion identified. THYROID: There is little thyroid tissue identified. CHEST WALL and breasts: Dense bilateral breast tissue is present. There is a likely calcification within the right breast. There is no significant supraclavicular or axillary lymphadenopathy. BONES AND SOFT TISSUES: There is a scoliotic curvature of the spine. No acute or aggressive osseous lesion is identified UPPER ABDOMEN: A splenule is present. IMPRESSION: 1. Stable 1.2 cm pulmonary nodule in the left lower lobe from the 9/4/2023 examination.

            "answer": "CTA CHEST FOR PE EXAMINATION: CTA of the chest with IV contrast History : Dyspnea TECHNIQUE: Pulmonary embolus protocol - Thin-slice axial imaging of the chest was performed during maximal pulmonary arterial opacification with intravenous nonionic iodinated contrast. 3D coronal slab MIPs and 2D reconstructions in the coronal and sagittal planes were performed to aid in pulmonary embolus detection. Representative images have been stored on PACS. One of the following dose optimization techniques was utilized in the performance of this exam: Automated exposure control; adjustment of the mA and/or kV according to the patient's size; or use of an iterative reconstruction technique. Specific details can be referenced in the facility's radiology CT exam operational policy. Contrast: 75 cc of Isovue-370 COMPARISON STUDIES: CT 11/24/2023. FINDINGS: Please note that this exam is optimized for assessment of the pulmonary arteries and is not intended as a diagnostic study of the thoracic aorta, coronary arteries or venous structures. Angiographic Findings: Pulmonary arteries: There are no filling defects in the main, right, left, lobar, segmental or visualized sub-segmental branches of the pulmonary arterial system Other vasculature: Calcification of the thoracic aorta and coronary vessels. Additional non-angiographic findings: Lungs / Pleura: Severe background of emphysema. Tracheostomy tube is in good position. Large right middle lobe bulla is unchanged. Mild bronchial thickening and mucous plugging at the lung bases. Mediastinum / Hila: negative. Heart / Pericardium: Coronary atherosclerotic calcification. Lymph node assessment: negative Musculoskeletal / Body wall: Patient is osteopenic. Compression fractures of T4, T5, T6, T7, T8 and L1 are unchanged from prior CT. Upper abdomen: Cirrhotic morphology of the liver with a recanalized umbilical vein IMPRESSION: 1. No evidence for pulmonary emboli to the subsegmental level. 2. Severe background of emphysema. Tracheostomy tube in good position. Mild mucous plugging and bronchial thickening at both lung bases. 3. Cirrhotic morphology of the liver.

            "answer": "CTA CHEST FOR PE HISTORY: Syncope with head injury and right-sided rib pain. Injury occurred Saturday. COMPARISON: None. TECHNIQUE: Pulmonary embolus protocol: Thin-slice axial imaging of the chest was performed during maximal pulmonary arterial opacification with intravenous nonionic iodinated contrast. Sagittal and coronal reformats and axial, sagittal, and coronal MIP series were performed to aid in pulmonary embolus detection. One of the following dose optimization techniques was utilized in the performance of this exam: Automated exposure control; adjustment of the mA and/or kV according to the patient's size; or use of an iterative reconstruction technique. Specific details can be referenced in the facility's radiology CT exam operational policy. CONTRAST: 50 mL of IV Isovue-370. FINDINGS: PULMONARY ARTERIES: The pulmonary trunk is normal in caliber. Pulmonary arteries are adequately opacified to the subsegmental level. There are no pulmonary emboli in the visible pulmonary arteries. THORACIC INLET: Coarse calcifications at the left thyroid bed. AORTA AND ARCH BRANCH VESSELS: No aneurysm or dissection. There is mild to moderate atherosclerosis of the thoracic aorta. Moderate atherosclerosis of the visible abdominal aorta, including at the origins of the celiac trunk and superior mesenteric artery. No significant stenosis. There is mild to moderate atherosclerosis of the subclavian arteries. Aberrant right subclavian artery. Mild atherosclerosis of the common carotid arteries. Atherosclerosis of the bilateral vertebral origins. HEART/PERICARDIUM: The heart is normal size. Mitral annular calcification.. There is a trace physiologic pericardial effusion. There is mild LAD coronary artery calcification. MEDIASTINUM/HILA: Normal mediastinum. No lymphadenopathy. LUNGS/PLEURA: No pleural effusion. Peripheral reticulation, normal for age. Mild passive atelectasis. No pneumothorax. The airways are normal. UPPER ABDOMEN: Mild pancreatic atrophy. 1.3 cm indeterminate left adrenal nodule. Small sliding hiatal hernia. Diverticulosis at the splenic flexure without diverticulitis. MUSCULOSKELETAL/VERTEBRA/BODY WALL: Nondisplaced fractures of the anterior right third through fifth ribs. Mild tiny sclerotic lesion within the sixth lateral right rib suspect is a benign bone island, although is of uncertain etiology in this patient with a history of breast cancer. Spondylosis. Right mastectomy. Benign calcification within the left breast. IMPRESSION: 1. No pulmonary embolism. 2. Nondisplaced fractures of the anterior right third through fifth ribs. No pneumothorax. 3. Indeterminate 1.3 cm left adrenal nodule and sclerotic lesion within the sixth lateral right rib. If patient has outside studies, suggest comparison be made to assess for stability. 4.

TECHNICAL DATA: Following dynamic intravenous nonionic contrast infusion, multiple axial helical overlapped CT images with multiplanar reconstructions were obtained. All CT data was transferred to a 3D workstation for multiplanar reformation and 3D reconstruction under concurrent physician supervision. All CT scans at this facility use dose modulation, iterative reconstruction, and/or weight based dosing when appropriate to reduce radiation dose to as low as reasonably achievable. COMPARISONS: 8/31/2023 FINDINGS: Thoracic inlet: No focal lesion in the visualized thyroid gland. No supraclavicular lymphadenopathy Mediastinum: 13 mm precarinal node, no change from prior. Thoracic aorta: Atherosclerotic changes. No aneurysm. Pulmonary arteries: Nondilated. No pulmonary emboli. Heart: Heart size normal. No pericardial effusion. Upper abdomen: No acute findings. 18 mm left adrenal nodule. No change from prior. Lungs/Pleura: Tracheobronchial tree patent. No infiltrate, consolidation, or nodule. Bilateral apical scarring. Musculoskeletal: No acute osseous abnormality. Soft tissues: Soft tissues unremarkable. IMPRESSION: No pulmonary embolus. No acute CT abnormality. Chronic findings as above. 18 mm left adrenal nodule, no change from prior exam. Nonemergent Adrenal protocol CT would offer further characterization if indicated.

CONTRAST: Isovue-370, 70 mL COMPARISON: CTA dated 11/6/2023 FINDINGS: Heart/vessels: Heart size is within normal limits. There are some dense atheromatous calcifications in the coronary arteries. Normal three-vessel aortic arch. Evaluation of the pulmonary arteries is adequate for determination of pulmonary embolism to the proximal segmental level. There is no evidence of acute PE. Mediastinum: Mildly prominent left-sided hilar nodes are likely reactive Lungs/pleura: Since prior evaluation, there has been interval near resolution of the left upper lobe and anterior left lower lobe consolidative opacities but there is new left lower lobe posterior and dependent consolidative opacities with scattered consolidative opacities in the right base. The presence of these infectious or inflammatory changes limits evaluation for pulmonary nodule. There is a new or newly apparent left lower lobe pulmonary nodule on series 6 image two seven measuring 5 mm. Visualized upper abdomen: Negative. Bones/soft tissues: No acute osseous abnormality. Midthoracic degenerative changes. Left breast surgical clips are in place with somewhat mildly nodular soft tissue in this location. Recommend correlation with mammography as would be clinically indicated by patient age. IMPRESSION: 1. No evidence of acute PE. 2. Findings most compatible with left lower lobe pneumonia. Streaky and linear opacities in the left upper lobe are likely sequela of prior episode of pneumonia on 11/6/2023. Pneumonia appears to be in a different distribution than on prior study. Recommend follow-up imaging in 6-12 weeks after treatment to ensure resolution. A 5 mm left lower lobe pulmonary nodule is favored to be infectious or inflammatory. 3.

            "answer": "CTA CHEST FOR PE HISTORY: Anterior right-sided pleuritic chest pain. Elevated d-dimer. Ecchymoses at port site. COMPARISON: None. TECHNIQUE: Pulmonary embolus protocol: Thin-slice axial imaging of the chest was performed during maximal pulmonary arterial opacification with intravenous nonionic iodinated contrast. Sagittal and coronal reformats and sagittal and coronal MIP series were performed to aid in pulmonary embolus detection. One of the following dose optimization techniques was utilized in the performance of this exam: Automated exposure control; adjustment of the mA and/or kV according to the patient's size; or use of an iterative reconstruction technique. Specific details can be referenced in the facility's radiology CT exam operational policy. CONTRAST: 80 mL of IV Isovue-370. FINDINGS: PULMONARY ARTERIES: The pulmonary trunk is normal in caliber. Pulmonary arteries are adequately although not optimally opacified to the subsegmental level. Limited by respiratory motion and suboptimal contrast opacification. No central pulmonary embolism and no segmental or subsegmental pulmonary embolism within the limits of the examination. THORACIC INLET: Normal. AORTA AND ARCH BRANCH VESSELS: No aneurysm or dissection. There is no atherosclerosis of the aorta. HEART/PERICARDIUM: The heart is normal. ASD repair. There is no pericardial effusion. There is no coronary artery calcification. Right port terminates at the upper cavoatrial junction. MEDIASTINUM/HILA: Normal mediastinum. No lymphadenopathy. LUNGS/PLEURA: No pleural effusion. Respiratory motion. Lungs are clear. No pneumothorax. The airways are normal. UPPER ABDOMEN: Spleen is enlarged, measuring 14.1 cm. Sleeve gastrectomy. MUSCULOSKELETAL/VERTEBRA/BODY WALL: The hub of the right port is tilted toward the left (image 6 series 5). No surrounding stranding or fluid collection. Mild spondylosis. Mild chronic anterior wedging of T10, T11, and T12, which may be physiologic. IMPRESSION: 1. Limited by respiratory motion and suboptimal contrast opacification. No pulmonary embolus within the limits of the examination. 2. The hub of the right port is tilted toward the left. No surrounding stranding or fluid collection. 3. Splenomegaly.

Left infrahilar node measures 1.9 cm Lungs/pleura: Diffuse ground glass opacities in tree-in-bud opacities in the right lung apex and right upper lobe are noted. There are focal consolidations along the bilateral major fissures which may represent atelectasis. Additional groundglass and tree-in-bud opacities are seen in the right lower lobe Focal consolidations are seen in the bilateral lung bases. These probably have a component of atelectasis. Line there is bronchiectasis seen in the bilateral lower lobes. Loculated pleural effusions are noted in the bilateral lung bases. Bones/soft tissues: No acute osseous findings. No significant soft tissue abnormalities seen. Abdomen and pelvis: Hepatobiliary: Heterogeneous liver. The hepatic veins and portal vein appears patent. No focal masses are identified. The gallbladder is surgically absent. The common bile duct measures 1.2 cm in diameter. No intraluminal stones are noted. Spleen: Negative. Adrenals: Negative. Pancreas: Negative. Kidneys/GU: There is a mild right hydronephrosis and hydroureter upstream from a stone in the distal right ureter measuring 0.7 x 0.6 x 0.8 cm (series 3 image 145). No left hydronephrosis or hydroureter is identified. No left ureteral stones are noted. The bladder is unremarkable. GI: Enteric tube in place the tip in the stomach.

Representative images have been stored on PACS. One of the following dose optimization techniques was utilized in the performance of this exam: Automated exposure control; adjustment of the mA and/or kV according to the patient's size; or use of an iterative reconstruction technique. Specific details can be referenced in the facility's radiology CT exam operational policy. Contrast: 59 cc of Isovue-370 COMPARISON STUDIES: CT 9/7/2023 as well as priors. FINDINGS: Please note that this exam is optimized for assessment of the pulmonary arteries and is not intended as a diagnostic study of the thoracic aorta, coronary arteries or venous structures. Angiographic Findings: Pulmonary arteries: There are no filling defects in the main, right, left, lobar, segmental or visualized sub-segmental branches of the pulmonary arterial system Other vasculature: Metallic stent in the left subclavian artery is noted. Arteries are nonenhanced to assess patency. Ectasia of the aortic arch measures 2.9 cm. Prominent calcification of the coronary vessels.. Additional non-angiographic findings: Lungs / Pleura: 3 mm left upper lobe nodule (4/83), stable dating back to 2022 and considered benign. Ossified granuloma left lower lobe is stable.. Mediastinum / Hila: Mediastinal lipomatosis. Heart / Pericardium: Coronary atherosclerotic calcification. Lymph node assessment: negative Musculoskeletal / Body wall: Patient is osteopenic with degenerative endplate changes. Upper abdomen: negative IMPRESSION: 1.

TECHNIQUE: CTA chest with intravenous contrast attention to pulmonary arteries. CT abdomen and pelvis with intravenous contrast was performed. Sagittal, coronal and slab 3D MIP coronal reconstructed images were also created for further evaluation and interpretation. One of the following dose optimization techniques was utilized in the performance of this exam: Automated exposure control; adjustment of the mA and/or kV according to the patient's size; or use of an iterative reconstruction technique. Specific details can be referenced in the facility's radiology CT exam operational policy. CONTRAST: 90 mm Isovue-370. COMPARISON: CTA chest dated 2/3/2024, 1/25/2024. CT chest dated 5/18/2003. CT chest dated 6/3/2020. CT abdomen and pelvis, 12/23/2022. FINDINGS: CT Pulmonary angiography: Quality of exam: Diagnostic Pulmonary embolism: There is no pulmonary embolism to the proximal segmental level. Right heart strain: There is no evidence of right heart strain. Main Pulmonary Artery: Normal caliber. Main Pulmonary Artery diameter: 2.7 cm. Support devices: None. Lower cervical region: Unremarkable. Lymph nodes: There is no thoracic adenopathy. Pleural spaces/diaphragm:There is no pleural effusion. Heart/Pericardium/Great Vessels: Heart: normal size Coronary arteries: There is moderate calcific coronary artery atherosclerosis. Pericardium: no pericardial effusion Aorta: The contrast bolus is not optimally timed for aortic evaluation. There is calcific and noncalcific atherosclerotic plaques involving the thoracic aorta, with a rim of irregular atherosclerotic plaque involving the distal descending thoracic aorta, which is not significantly changed. A central tubular junction measures 3.0 cm in diameter. The ascending aorta measures up to 4.3 cm in diameter, previously 4.5 cm. The aortic arch measures up to 2.1 cm in diameter. The descending aorta measures 2.8 cm in diameter. Lungs: The trachea and central airways are clear. An 8 mm solid nodule in the right upper lobe (4/27) is not significantly changed in size compared to prior CTs dating back to 2020, compatible with a benign nodule given the stability, for which no follow-up is warranted. Dependent subsegmental atelectasis versus scarring of the posterior lower lobes and basilar lungs. Upper GI tract: The proximal esophagus is dilated and contains mucus/small amount of fluid. Body wall:Degenerative changes are seen in the thoracic spine. Incompletely imaged anterior fixation hardware in the lower cervical spine. FINDINGS CT ABDOMEN/PELVIS: Liver: A subcentimeter low-density focus in the caudate lobe is too small to characterize, not significantly changed. Biliary tree: The patient is post cholecystectomy. There is no biliary ductal dilatation. Spleen: unremarkable Pancreas: Unremarkable. Adrenal glands: Unremarkable. Kidneys: There are bilateral symmetric nephrograms without hydronephrosis. Small low density foci in the kidneys are too small to characterize. Bilateral renal cysts are noted, for which no follow-up is warranted. Lymph nodes: Abdomen: There is no abdominal adenopathy. Pelvis: There is no pelvic adenopathy. Vasculature: There is no abdominal aortic aneurysm. Atherosclerotic calcification is seen. There is a circumaortic left renal vein. Peritoneum/mesentery/omentum: There is no free fluid or free air. GI tract: There is no bowel obstruction. The left hemipelvis is obscured by artifact from the left hip arthroplasty. Within the limits of the study, there is sigmoid colonic diverticulosis without evidence of acute diverticulitis. A potential tiny appendix is visualized and is within normal limits. No secondary signs of appendicitis in the right lower abdomen. Pelvic urogenital structures:The bladder is is obscured by artifact from the left hip arthroplasty. The uterus is not seen. Body wall: There are degenerative changes in the spine. Grade 1 L5 on S1 anterolisthesis. Status post L5 knee. There is fatty atrophy of the left psoas muscle. The appearance is mild coarsening of the left hemipelvis. Key: (S/I) = series number / image number Lungs/Central Airways: IMPRESSION: Ascending aortic aneurysm measuring up to 4.3 cm is not significantly changed. No evidence of acute thoracic aortic dissection or pulmonary embolism to the first subsegmental level. The proximal esophagus is dilated, which can increase the risk of aspiration. No other acute abnormality in the abdomen and pelvis to explain patient's abdominal pain. Report E-Signed By: Lucy Lester, MD at 2/6/2024 6:01 PM WSN:AMICRAD90",

Angiographic Findings: Pulmonary arteries: There are no filling defects in the main, right, left, lobar, segmental or visualized sub-segmental branches of the pulmonary arterial system Other vasculature: Main pulmonary arteries enlarged measures 3.5 cm suggesting pulmonary arterial hypertension. Atherosclerotic calcification of the thoracic aorta, coronary vessels and aortic valve. Additional non-angiographic findings: Lungs / Pleura: Airspace disease and consolidation in both lungs worse at the left lung base suggests multifocal pneumonia. Small amount of mucous in the trachea.. Mediastinum / Hila: negative. Heart / Pericardium: Ectasia of the mid ascending thoracic aorta measures 3.5 cm. Coronary artery calcification. Lymph node assessment: negative Musculoskeletal / Body wall: Osteopenia and degenerative changes. Some ankylosis of the mid thoracic spine Upper abdomen: negative IMPRESSION: 1. No evidence for pulmonary embolus to the subsegmental level. 2. Scattered areas of airspace disease in both lungs with more focal left lower lobe consolidation suggests multifocal pneumonia.

One of the following dose optimization techniques was utilized in the performance of this exam: Automated exposure control; adjustment of the mA and/or kV according to the patient's size; or use of an iterative reconstruction technique. Specific details can be referenced in the facility's radiology CT exam operational policy. CONTRAST: 120 mL Isovue-370 COMPARISON: Prior CT of the chest dated January 13, 2024. CT of the abdomen and pelvis dated November 16, 2023. FINDINGS: Chest: Heart/vessels: There is four-chamber enlargement of the heart. No pericardial effusion is identified. No coronary artery or valvular calcifications are seen. There is smooth prominence of the ascending aorta measuring up to 4.5 cm in transverse diameter. This has increased since the January 13, 2024 exam when the transverse diameter measuring up to 4.0 seen no aortic dissection is identified. The pulmonary trunk is enlarged measuring 3.2 cm in diameter. No filling defects are seen within the pulmonary arterial system indicate pulmonary embolus. Mediastinum: Fat density mass in the posterior mediastinum is unchanged. This underwent benign CT-guided biopsy on January 22, 2024. No significant inflammatory changes are seen within the mass or along the biopsy tract. Lymph nodes: No adenopathy by CT criteria. Lungs/pleura: Opacities in the lower lobes may represent mild pulmonary edema. No pneumothorax or pleural effusion is seen. No acute osseous findings. No significant soft tissue abnormalities noted. Bones/soft tissues: No acute osseous findings. No significant soft tissue abnormalities seen. Abdomen and pelvis: Hepatobiliary: The liver is normal in size. Low-attenuation focus in the hepatic dome probably represents a cyst. This is too small to characterize. No biliary dilatation is identified. The gallbladder is unremarkable. Spleen: Negative. Adrenals: Negative. Pancreas: Negative. Kidneys: The kidneys enhance symmetrically. No inflammatory changes are identified. No hydronephrosis or calcified stones are seen. The ureters have a normal course and caliber. The bladder is unremarkable. The uterus and ovaries are not well visualized. GI: The stomach and duodenum are unremarkable. No small bowel obstruction is identified. The appendix is normal. There is diverticulosis of the descending and sigmoid colon without CT evidence of diverticulitis. Vessels/spaces/nodes: The ascending aorta appears normal in size on the CT of the abdomen and pelvis and unchanged from the prior exam. No free air or free fluid is identified. No adenopathy by CT criteria. Bones/soft tissues: No acute osseous findings. No significant soft tissue abnormalities seen. IMPRESSION: 1. No CT evidence of pulmonary embolus. 2. Stable fat density mass in the posterior mediastinum. This underwent benign CT-guided biopsy on January 22, 2024. No significant inflammatory changes are seen within the mass or along the biopsy tract. 3. Smooth prominence of the ascending aorta measuring up to 4.5 cm in transverse diameter. This has increased since the prior exam when the transverse diameter measuring up to 4.0 cm. This may be artifactual as the ascending aorta appears normal on the CT of the abdomen and pelvis. 4. Opacities in the lower lobes may represent mild pulmonary edema. 5. No acute findings in the abdomen or pelvis. Report E-Signed By: G. Thomas Alexander, MD at 2/4/2024 9:55 PM WSN:M-RAD020",

Post-processing was performed with creation of maximum intensity projection images (MIP). All CT scans at this facility use dose modulation, interactive reconstruction, and/or weight based dosing when appropriate to reduce radiation dose to as low as reasonably achievable. CLINICAL HISTORY: Pulmonary embolism (PE) suspected, unknown D-dimer COMPARISON: Radiograph 2/4/2024 and CT 6/20/2023 FINDINGS: Study Quality: There is adequate enhancement to the level of the subsegmental pulmonary arteries. Pulmonary arteries: No acute pulmonary artery embolus. Thoracic inlet: No adenopathy. Axillae and thoracic wall: No adenopathy. Mediastinum: No adenopathy. Aorta: Non-dilated. Heart: Post surgical changes from a CABG. Coronary artery calcifications. Reflux of contrast material into the hepatic veins. Central airways, lung parenchyma, and pleura: No pleural effusion. No central airway obstruction. Groundglass opacities at the lung bases. Upper abdomen: Normal. Musculoskeletal structures: No acute or aggressive lesion. IMPRESSION: 1. No acute embolus to the level of the subsegmental pulmonary arteries. 2. Reflux of contrast material into the hepatic veins, which can be seen in the setting of right heart dysfunction. 3. Groundglass opacities at the lung bases which could represent atelectasis, edema, or infection in the appropriate clinical setting.

Sagittal, coronal and slab 3D MIP coronal reconstructed images were also created for further evaluation and interpretation. One of the following dose optimization techniques was utilized in the performance of this exam: Automated exposure control; adjustment of the mA and/or kV according to the patient's size; or use of an iterative reconstruction technique. Specific details can be referenced in the facility's radiology CT exam operational policy. CONTRAST: 50 mL Isovue-370. COMPARISON: None. FINDINGS: Heart/vessels: Satisfactory opacification the pulmonary arteries without visualized pulmonary embolus. Moderate/advanced calcifications within the coronary arteries. Mild/moderate atherosclerosis within the thoracic aorta. Mediastinum: Negative. Lymph nodes: Negative. Lungs/pleura: Background of moderate/advanced emphysematous change. Bibasilar atelectasis. No concerning pulmonary infiltrate or consolidation. Nonspecific 6 mm left apical pulmonary nodule (image 39 of series 4). 3 mm left upper lobe nodule (image 106). Visualized upper abdomen: Moderate atherosclerosis. Bones/soft tissues: No acute or concerning abnormality. Surgical clips within the right axilla. Mild likely chronic T6 superior plate compression deformity. IMPRESSION: 1. No acute findings. Negative for pulmonary embolus. 2. Additional incidental/chronic findings, as above. 3. Nonspecific 6 mm left apical pulmonary nodule. RECOMMENDATION Pulmonary nodule: Non-contrast chest CT at 3-6 months is recommended. If the nodules are stable at time of repeat CT, then future CT at 18-24 months (from today's scan) is considered optional for low-risk patients, but is recommended for high-risk patients (Per Fleischner Society guidelines).

            "answer": "CTA CHEST FOR PE HISTORY: Pulmonary embolism (PE) suspected, high prob TECHNIQUE: Pulmonary embolus protocol - Thin-slice axial imaging of the chest was performed during maximal pulmonary arterial opacification with intravenous nonionic iodinated contrast. 3D coronal slab MIPs and 2D reconstructions in the coronal and sagittal planes were performed to aid in pulmonary embolus detection. Representative images have been stored on PACS. One of the following dose optimization techniques was utilized in the performance of this exam: Automated exposure control; adjustment of the mA and/or kV according to the patient's size; or use of an iterative reconstruction technique. Specific details can be referenced in the facility's radiology CT exam operational policy. CONTRAST: 130 mL of IV Isovue-370. COMPARISON: None available. FINDINGS: CTA CHEST: Please note that this exam is optimized for assessment of the pulmonary arteries and is not intended as a diagnostic study of the thoracic aorta, coronary arteries or venous structures. Angiographic Findings: Pulmonary arteries: Images are moderately degraded by respiratory motion artifact and suboptimal contrast bolus timing. Within these confines, there are no filling defects in the main, right, left, lobar or visualized segmental branches of the pulmonary arterial system. Other vasculature: Mild atherosclerotic calcification along the thoracic aorta without aneurysm. Additional non-angiographic findings: Lower neck: Negative. Lungs / Pleura: Solid pulmonary nodule in the left lower lobe measuring 5 mm (series 11, image 221). Smaller subpleural solid pulmonary nodule just superior and lateral to this in the left lower lobe measuring 2 mm (series 11, image 203). No airspace consolidation, pleural effusion or pneumothorax. Mediastinum / Hila: There are several mildly enlarged right hilar lymph nodes, for example a 1.0 cm lymph node in the inferior right hilum (series 5, image 52). A few borderline prominent left hilar lymph nodes and mediastinal lymph nodes. Heart / Pericardium: Cardiac size upper limits of normal. No pericardial effusion. Musculoskeletal / Body wall: Negative. Upper abdomen: Negative. IMPRESSION: 1. No evidence of pulmonary embolism to the segmental level. 2. No acute CT findings in the chest. 3. Mildly enlarged right hilar lymph nodes and borderline prominent mediastinal and left hilar lymph nodes. 4. Two solid pulmonary nodules in the left lower lobe, the larger of these measuring 5 mm. See guidelines below. ---------- FLEISCHNER SOCIETY FOLLOW-UP GUIDELINES FOR NEWLY DETECTED INCIDENTAL NODULES IN PERSONS 35 YEARS OF AGE OR OLDER. *These recommendations do NOT apply to lung cancer screening, patients with immunosuppression or patients with a known primary malignancy. MULTIPLE SOLID NODULES If nodule size is 8 mm: * Low risk patient: CT at 3-6 months, then consider CT at 18-24 months if no change. * High risk patient: CT at 3-6 months, then consider CT at 18-24 months if no change. LOW RISK PATIENT: Minimal or absent history of tobacco use and of other known risk factors. HIGH RISK PATIENT: Tobacco use, family history of lung cancer, upper pulmonary lobe location of nodule, presence of emphysema, pulmonary fibrosis, older age. MacMahon H, Naidich DP, Goo JM, et al.

Enlarged left paraesophageal node measuring 11 mm. Heart and great vessels: No pulmonary artery embolism. Are No pericardial effusion. The main pulmonary artery is normal in caliber. The ascending thoracic aorta is normal in caliber. Lungs, airway and pleura: There is a 5.2 x 1.6 cm are pleural-based nodules in the right lung base (image 35, series 7). Associated large pleural effusion. Peripheral patchy groundglass opacities in left upper lobe (image 195 series 7). Appearance is suggestive of underlying atypical infection. The right middle lobe and right lower lobe are partially collapsed. Extensive nodular thickening of the right hemidiaphragm (image 21, series 9). Soft tissue and Axilla: Subcentimeter left axillary nodes. Subtle nodular areas of increased attenuation of subcutaneous fat of the chest wall may reflect sequelae of prior trauma or inflammation. ABDOMEN/PELVIS: Liver: Multiple hypoattenuating masses in the right hepatic lobe with a dominant mass measuring 9.1 x 8.0 cm. Patent portal vasculature. Bile ducts: Negative. Gallbladder: Negative. Pancreas: Negative. Spleen: Negative. Adrenals: Negative. Kidneys and Bladder: Negative. Reproductive organs: Negative. Gastrointestinal tract: Appendix is normal in caliber small amount gas in the lumen. Formed stool is seen in the right colon and transverse colon left colon and sigmoid are largely decompressed. No obvious colonic mass identified. Large hiatal hernia. Mesentery/Peritoneum: Small volume pelvic free fluid and nodular peritoneal thickening consistent with peritoneal carcinomatosis. Omental nodular disease consistent with omental caking (image 49, series 9). Right lower quadrant implant measuring 48 x 41 mm (image 110, series 9). Retroperitoneum: Enlarged aortocaval node the level of the SMA measuring 22 x 44 mm (image 42, series 9). Retrocaval node measuring 21 mm.

Supraumbilical hernia with a metastatic implant measuring 28 x 32 mm (image 89, series 9). Left rectus abdominis implant measuring 15 x 25 mm (image 90, series 9). There is an indeterminant sclerotic focus in the T10 vertebral body (image 81, series 903). IMPRESSION: Findings of metastatic disease with a large malignant right pleural effusion, mediastinal and left supraclavicular adenopathy, nodular right diaphragmatic thickening, retroperitoneal adenopathy, peritoneal carcinomatosis, anterior abdominal wall soft tissue implants and multiple hypoattenuating hepatic masses. There is no clear primary identified on this study. Could consider primary hepatic malignancy such as cholangiocarcinoma although absence of associated biliary dilation would be atypical. Recommend oncologic referral and correlation with tissue sampling. Soft tissue implant involving the patient's supraumbilical hernia would likely be amenable to percutaneous biopsy. No pulmonary artery embolism. Large right malignant pleural effusion with associated near-complete collapse the right lower lobe and partial collapse the right middle lobe.

Multiplanar reconstructions were generated. All CT data was transferred to a 3D workstation for multiplanar reformation and 3D reconstruction under concurrent physician supervision. All CT scans at this facility use dose modulation, iterative reconstruction, and/or weight based dosing when appropriate to reduce radiation dose to as low as reasonably achievable. COMPARISON: None available FINDINGS: No filling defects in the main pulmonary arteries or segmental branches to suggest pulmonary embolism. No thoracic lymphadenopathy. Small bilateral pleural effusions. Large pericardial effusion. No acute lung abnormalities. Dependent atelectatic changes. No significant lung nodule or lung mass. The central airways appear patent. No acute abnormalities in the upper abdomen. No acute bone abnormalities. IMPRESSION: Impression: No evidence for pulmonary embolism. Large pericardial effusion Small bilateral pleural effusions.

Sagittal, coronal and slab 3D MIP coronal reconstructed images were also created for further evaluation and interpretation. One of the following dose optimization techniques was utilized in the performance of this exam: Automated exposure control; adjustment of the mA and/or kV according to the patient's size; or use of an iterative reconstruction technique. Specific details can be referenced in the facility's radiology CT exam operational policy. CONTRAST: 80 mL of Isovue-370 COMPARISON: CTA head and neck dated 5/26/2021 FINDINGS: PULMONARY CTA FINDINGS: This is a diagnostic quality helical CT pulmonary angiogram. There is no acute pulmonary embolism to the first subsegmental pulmonary artery level. OTHER FINDINGS: Support Devices: None. Heart/Pericardium/Great Vessels: Cardiac size is normal. There is no calcific coronary artery atherosclerosis. There is no pericardial effusion. The thoracic aorta is normal in caliber. The main pulmonary artery is normal in diameter. Pleural Spaces: The pleural spaces are clear. Mediastinum/Hila: There is no mediastinal or hilar lymph node enlargement. Neck Base/Chest Wall/Diaphragm/Upper Abdomen: A right thyroid heterogeneous mass is not significantly changed compared to 5/26/2021, which was previously biopsied and evaluated to represent a hyperplastic nodule. There is no supraclavicular or axillary lymph node enlargement. Limited imaging through the upper abdomen demonstrates postcholecystectomy clips and a suture line in the proximal stomach. Degenerative change is present in the spine. Calcific density at the posterior aspect of the left humeral head possibly related to calcific tendinopathy. Lungs/Central Airways: The trachea and central airways are clear. There is mild dependent atelectasis in the posterior lungs. IMPRESSION: No evidence of acute pulmonary embolism to the first subsegmental level. No acute abnormality in the chest. Report E-Signed By: Lucy Lester, MD at 2/8/2024 4:24 PM WSN:AMICRAD90",

Representative images have been stored on PACS. One of the following dose optimization techniques was utilized in the performance of this exam: Automated exposure control; adjustment of the mA and/or kV according to the patient's size; or use of an iterative reconstruction technique. Specific details can be referenced in the facility's radiology CT exam operational policy. Contrast: 70 cc of Isovue-370 COMPARISON STUDIES: CT chest 1/15/2024 as well as priors. FINDINGS: Please note that this exam is optimized for assessment of the pulmonary arteries and is not intended as a diagnostic study of the thoracic aorta, coronary arteries or venous structures. Angiographic Findings: Pulmonary arteries: There are no filling defects in the main, right, left, lobar, segmental or visualized sub-segmental branches of the pulmonary arterial system Other vasculature: High-grade narrowing of the origin of the left subclavian artery due to noncalcified plaque. Calcified coronary atherosclerotic disease. Right-sided chemotherapy catheter has the tip in the right heart. Additional non-angiographic findings: Lungs / Pleura: Reidentified is extensive metastatic disease to the chest. The right-sided pleural effusion has resolved. Numerous pulmonary nodules and pleural nodules on the right are otherwise essentially stable. Patient may have pleural carcinomatosis on the right based on the pleural nodularity. Index right lower lobe nodule measures 29 x 17 mm (2/145), stable. Several pulmonary pleural nodules on the left. Index left lower lobe nodule has enlarged measures 19 x 16 mm (2/181), previously 15 x 12 mm. Mediastinum / Hila: Reidentified is metastatic right lower cervical and mediastinal adenopathy which encases the right main pulmonary artery and right hilar structures extends superiorly and right paratracheal space, similar prior. The right mainstem bronchus, bronchus to right upper lobe bronchus intermedius or encased but patent. Index precarinal lymph node mass measures 2.6 x 2 cm which is stable. Small bilateral level 4 cervical lymph nodes are also potentially metastatic. Index left level 4 lymph node measures 10 x 7 mm (2/27). Index right level 4 cervical lymph node measures 8 x 6 mm (2/24. There is also some posterior mediastinal adenopathy adjacent to the aorta measuring 7 mm (2/153). . Heart / Pericardium: Coronary atherosclerotic calcification. Right-sided chemotherapy catheter has the tip the right heart. Narrowing of the SVC better appreciated on prior CT. Lymph node assessment: Metastatic adenopathy described above Musculoskeletal / Body wall: Extensive osseous metastatic disease not grossly changed from prior exam Upper abdomen: Extensive hepatic metastatic disease will be described on CT of the abdomen. IMPRESSION: 1. No evidence for pulmonary embolus subsegmental level. 2. Interval resolution of the small right pleural effusion. 3. Extensive metastatic disease not significantly changed from prior CT 1/15/2024. Mild enlargement of the left lower lobe nodule. Other index measurements given above. 4.

Sagittal, and coronal reformats were created by the technologist. Post-processed, reconstructed multiplanar reformatted MIP images of the chest were also provided. All CT scans at this facility use dose modulation, iterative reconstruction, and/or weight based dosing when appropriate to reduce radiation dose to as low as reasonably achievable. FINDINGS: Mediastinum:Normal appearance of the thyroid. No mediastinal or hilar lymphadenopathy. . Opacification of the pulmonary arteries is appropriate for evaluation of pulmonary embolus on this exam. No pulmonary arterial filling defects are seen to suggest pulmonary embolus. Dilation of the pulmonary trunk, main pulmonary arteries and central pulmonary arteries is noted. The thoracic aorta appears normal in course and caliber. Coronary artery calcifications are seen throughout the distribution of the left main, LAD, circumflex and right coronary arteries. Dense mitral annulus calcifications are noted. Cardiac enlargement. No pericardial effusion. Lungs and pleura: Small right pleural effusion. Trace left pleural effusion. Complete collapse of the right middle lobe is noted. Dependent atelectasis is seen in the right and left lower lobes. No left effusion. No right or left pneumothorax. Normal appearance of the trachea and mainstem bronchi. Chest wall: No axillary lymphadenopathy. Soft tissue edema is seen throughout the right greater than left flanks. Bones: Advanced osteoarthritic change of the right glenohumeral joint. Postoperative changes of the left humeral head. Spondylitic changes are seen throughout the imaged portions of the spine. No acute or suspicious osseous findings are seen involving the thoracic spine, sternum or ribs. Upper abdomen: Visualized portions of the upper abdomen are unremarkable. IMPRESSION: 1. No pulmonary embolus is seen. 2. Small right and trace left pleural effusions. 3. Complete collapse of the right middle lobe. Dependent atelectasis is seen in the right and left lower lobes. 4. Dilation of the pulmonary trunk, main pulmonary arteries and central pulmonary arteries is noted. Correlate for clinical signs or symptoms of pulmonary arterial hypertension. 5. Coronary artery disease as above. Other chronic and incidental findings as above. Report E-Signed By: Jason M Allen, DO at 2/14/2024 12:48 AM WSN:RICRADHOME11",

Multiplanar reconstructions were generated. All CT data was transferred to a 3D workstation for multiplanar reformation and 3D reconstruction under concurrent physician supervision. All CT scans at this facility use dose modulation, iterative reconstruction, and/or weight based dosing when appropriate to reduce radiation dose to as low as reasonably achievable. COMPARISON: Radiographs February 9, 2024, PET/CT February 8, 2024 FINDINGS: Right port extends to the superior vena cava. No filling defects in the main pulmonary arteries or segmental branches to suggest pulmonary embolism. Large mediastinal mass and complex present lymphadenopathy appears stable. There is continued compression of the superior vena cava without complete occlusion. No pleural effusion. No pericardial effusion. No acute lung abnormalities. Scattered linear atelectatic changes. No significant lung nodule or lung mass. The central airways appear patent. No acute abnormalities in the upper abdomen. No acute bone abnormalities. S-shaped thoracic scoliosis.

Representative images have been stored on PACS. EKG gating: no Contrast: 75 ml Isovue 370 One of the following dose optimization techniques was utilized in the performance of this exam: Automated exposure control; adjustment of the mA and/or kV according to the patient's size; or use of an iterative reconstruction technique. Specific details can be referenced in the facility's radiology CT exam operational policy. COMPARISON STUDIES: No relevant priors FINDINGS: Angiographic Findings: Pulmonary arteries: There are no filling defects in the main, right, left, lobar, segmental or visualized sub-segmental branches of the pulmonary arterial system Thoracic aorta: negative. Additional non-angiographic findings: Lungs / pleura / hila: There is no consolidation or effusion. Background patchy mosaic pattern of density throughout both lungs. A think the lower density areas are abnormal revealing emphysematous disease. Superimposed are multiple subpleural cysts primarily located in the right middle lobe and the medial left lower lobe. Largest one of the right 5.4 cm. A partially loculated cystic structure in the anterior left lung base measures 5.5 x 5.9 cm with a dependent fluid level, potentially infected or recently bleeding. Lower neck: negative Mediastinum: negative Heart / pericardium: negative Other Vessels: negative Body wall: negative Upper abdomen: negative Lymph nodes: negative Bones: negative CT ABDOMEN PELVIS: Technique: Spiral scan was obtained from the lower chest through the symphysis with intravenous contrast One of the following dose optimization techniques was utilized in the performance of this exam: Automated exposure control; adjustment of the mA and/or kV according to the patient's size; or use of an iterative reconstruction technique.

Bowel / peritoneum / mesenteries: No obstruction or acute inflammatory disease. Normal appendix. Vessels: negative Lymph nodes: negative Body wall: Moderate sized fat-containing non-inflamed sub-umbilical hernia. No bowel herniation. Musculoskeletal: There is a circumscribed lobulated heavily rim calcified lesion of the left femoral neck and upper diaphysis extending from and ostium to the endosteum but without evidence of expansion. No periostitis or soft tissue component. Multifocal small cystic lesions noted in the left femoral head. IMPRESSION: CTA CHEST: 1. There is no CT evidence of acute pulmonary embolism. 2. Emphysematous disease with cystic changes as above. One of these cysts in the anterior left lower lobe demonstrating dependent fluid level suggests either hemorrhage or infection. Doubt neoplasm. CT ABDOMEN PELVIS: 1. No source of sepsis identified. 2. Normal appendix. 3. Left femoral lesion as above. This appears nonaggressive and is likely fibro-osseous in origin. Low-grade chondrosarcoma is possible but I think unlikely. I would suggest a baseline left hip radiograph with follow-up hip radiograph in 6 months to document stability.

            "answer": "CTA CHEST FOR PE HISTORY: Pulmonary embolism (PE) suspected, unknown D-dimer TECHNIQUE: Pulmonary embolus protocol - Thin-slice axial imaging of the chest was performed during maximal pulmonary arterial opacification with intravenous nonionic iodinated contrast. 3D coronal slab MIPs and 2D reconstructions in the coronal and sagittal planes were performed to aid in pulmonary embolus detection. Representative images have been stored on PACS. One of the following dose optimization techniques was utilized in the performance of this exam: Automated exposure control; adjustment of the mA and/or kV according to the patient's size; or use of an iterative reconstruction technique. Specific details can be referenced in the facility's radiology CT exam operational policy. CONTRAST: 70 mL of IV Isovue-370. COMPARISON: None available. FINDINGS: CTA CHEST: Please note that this exam is optimized for assessment of the pulmonary arteries and is not intended as a diagnostic study of the thoracic aorta, coronary arteries or venous structures. Angiographic Findings: Pulmonary arteries: There are no filling defects in the main, right, left, lobar, segmental or visualized sub-segmental branches of the pulmonary arterial system. Other vasculature: Mild atherosclerotic calcification along the thoracic aorta without aneurysm. Additional non-angiographic findings: Lower neck: Negative. Lungs / Pleura: Mostly confluent groundglass opacities in the bilateral central lungs. There may be superimposed areas of consolidation. Background interlobular septal thickening and mild bronchial wall thickening throughout the lungs. Large right and moderate to large left pleural effusion. Mediastinum / Hila: No lymphadenopathy. Patulous esophagus with layering fluid up to the mid thoracic level. Heart / Pericardium: Borderline prominent heart size. No pericardial effusion. Musculoskeletal / Body wall: Chronic left rib deformities. Left greater than right glenohumeral degenerative changes. Upper abdomen: Dictated separately. IMPRESSION: 1. No evidence of pulmonary embolism. 2. Bilateral perihilar groundglass opacities in the bilateral lungs with possible components of consolidation. There are also moderate to large bilateral pleural effusions. The findings could be related to pulmonary edema with superimposed infection or inflammation also possible.

Representative images have been stored on PACS. EKG gating: no Contrast: 80 ml Isovue 370 One of the following dose optimization techniques was utilized in the performance of this exam: Automated exposure control; adjustment of the mA and/or kV according to the patient's size; or use of an iterative reconstruction technique. Specific details can be referenced in the facility's radiology CT exam operational policy. COMPARISON STUDIES: Today's chest x-ray and prior outside CT chest 01/22/24 FINDINGS: Angiographic Findings: Pulmonary arteries: There are no filling defects in the main, right, left, lobar, segmental or visualized sub-segmental branches of the pulmonary arterial system Thoracic aorta: negative. Additional non-angiographic findings: Lungs / pleura / hila: 5.5 x 6 cm medial right upper lobe mass abutting the mediastinum is little changed in size from prior. Encasement of the right upper lobe bronchus is similar. Multiple pulmonary nodules scattered in both lungs are little changed. Largest is located in the anterior right lower lobe adjacent to the lower fissure, 14 mm. There are new small, right greater than left water density pleural effusions. No obvious pleural-based masses. There is progressive soft tissue encasing the superior division of the right pulmonary vein resulting in advanced narrowing but no full occlusion. This finding is concerning for progressive malignancy. Additional tissue abuts the inferior division of the left pulmonary vein with adjacent atelectasis and/or infiltrate of the left lower lobe. This finding appears to be mostly atelectatic in origin. Lower neck: negative Mediastinum: Essentially stable adenopathy. Heart / pericardium: New large water density pericardial effusion. Dependent component 2.7 cm, nondependent component 1.8 cm. Water attenuation. New straightening of the ventricular septum may indicate developing cor pulmonale. No obvious new pericardial or cardiac based masses. Other Vessels: Per above Body wall: Right axillary clips. No new axillary adenopathy. Upper abdomen: negative Lymph nodes: See above. No significant additional lymph node findings. Bones: No lytic or blastic osseous lesions. IMPRESSION: 1. There is no CT evidence of acute pulmonary embolism. 2. Stable large mass medial right upper lobe and metastatic lesions both lungs. There is though what appears to be tumor progression in the central right lung encasing the superior division of the right pulmonary vein. 3. Large pericardial effusion, new from prior CT. No obvious pericardial based metastases. Correlate for cor pulmonale. 4. New bilateral pleural effusions, right greater than left. No obvious pleural-based metastases.

Sagittal, coronal and slab 3D MIP coronal reconstructed images were also created for further evaluation and interpretation. One of the following dose optimization techniques was utilized in the performance of this exam: Automated exposure control; adjustment of the mA and/or kV according to the patient's size; or use of an iterative reconstruction technique. Specific details can be referenced in the facility's radiology CT exam operational policy. CONTRAST: 55 mL of IV Isovue-370 COMPARISON: 3/1/2023 FINDINGS: Please note the study is limited due to motion at the lung bases. There is no axillary, mediastinal, or hilar lymphadenopathy. No pleural or pericardial effusions are seen. Evaluation the pulmonary arteries is limited due to timing of the bolus as the lower lobe arteries are poorly opacified. The opacified pulmonary arteries are patent with no intraluminal filling defects identified. There is no evidence of pulmonary embolus. There are mild bibasilar groundglass opacities which may represent dependent atelectasis. There is right lower lobe discoid atelectasis. The lungs are otherwise clear with no mass or consolidation seen. There is no pneumothorax. The airway is patent. The heart is normal in size and the aorta is unremarkable. The visualized upper abdomen is unremarkable as well. IMPRESSION: Limited but unremarkable CT angiogram of the chest with no evidence of pulmonary embolus. There are bibasilar opacities which may simple represent dependent atelectasis. Please note the study is somewhat limited due to motion at the lung bases as well as timing of the bolus with poor opacification of the lower lobe pulmonary arteries.

Representative images have been stored on PACS. EKG gating: no Contrast: 56 ml Isovue 370 One of the following dose optimization techniques was utilized in the performance of this exam: Automated exposure control; adjustment of the mA and/or kV according to the patient's size; or use of an iterative reconstruction technique. Specific details can be referenced in the facility's radiology CT exam operational policy. COMPARISON STUDIES: Today's chest radiograph FINDINGS: Angiographic Findings: Pulmonary arteries: There are no filling defects in the main, right, left, lobar, segmental or visualized sub-segmental branches of the pulmonary arterial system Thoracic aorta: negative. Additional non-angiographic findings: Lungs / pleura / hila: No consolidation or effusion. Patchy mosaicism dependently in both lungs, probably benign atelectatic in origin. Nonspecific. Airways widely patent. Lower neck: negative Mediastinum: negative Heart / pericardium: negative Other Vessels: negative Body wall: negative Upper abdomen: Several scattered small round circumscribed hypodensities, very likely benign cysts, largest in the medial segment left lobe, 16 mm. No suspect hepatic lesion. Surface is smooth. Lymph nodes: negative Bones: negative IMPRESSION: 1. There is no CT evidence of acute pulmonary embolism. 2. Minor patchy dependent groundglass density in the lung bases, nonspecific and probably merely atelectatic in origin. Mild pneumonitis might produce a similar appearance. 3. Benign-appearing hepatic cysts. No follow-up warranted. Report E-Signed By: Richard Pacini, MD at 2/12/2024 4:07 PM WSN:AMIC01553",

PET/CT performed 1/19/2024 TECHNICAL DATA: Helical CT data through the chest after the uneventful intravenous administration of 75 ml of Isovue 370. Sagittal, and coronal reformats were created by the technologist. Post-processed, reconstructed multiplanar reformatted MIP images of the chest were also provided. All CT scans at this facility use dose modulation, iterative reconstruction, and/or weight based dosing when appropriate to reduce radiation dose to as low as reasonably achievable. FINDINGS: Mediastinum:Normal appearance of the thyroid. No mediastinal or hilar lymphadenopathy. Opacification of the pulmonary arteries is appropriate for evaluation of pulmonary embolus on this exam. No pulmonary arterial filling defects are seen to suggest pulmonary embolus. The pulmonary arteries and thoracic aorta are normal in course and caliber. Diffuse cardiac enlargement. Trace-small pericardial effusion. Normal appearance of the esophagus.. Lungs and pleura: There is a focal area of possible developing consolidation versus dense atelectasis in the posterior inferior right lower lobe which appears new in comparison with the 1/19/2024 exam. Somewhat nodular, hazy areas of increased density are also seen in the inferior left lower lobe which appear new in comparison with prior imaging, possibly representing additional developing consolidation. No pneumothorax or pleural effusions. Redemonstration of a small fat-containing Bochdalek hernia at the posterior inferior right hemithorax. Normal appearance of the trachea and mainstem bronchi. Chest wall: No axillary lymphadenopathy. Redemonstration of numerous lytic and sclerotic lesions throughout the imaged portions of the axial and appendicular skeleton corresponding to known osseous metastatic disease. Upper abdomen: Visualized portions of the upper abdomen are unremarkable. IMPRESSION: 1. No pulmonary embolus is seen. 2. There is a focal area of possible developing consolidation versus dense atelectasis in the posterior inferior right lower lobe which appears new in comparison with the 1/19/2024 exam.

Within the right lower lobe, there are tree-in-bud-like branching opacities redemonstrated which are not significantly changed since prior. Additionally, there is no significant change in fibrotic appearance of the right lower anterior lobe.. There are a few fine reticular subpleural interstitial opacities left lower lobe which are increased from prior. Additional left lower lobe anterior scarring is present. There is diffuse bronchiolar, which is new since prior. Wall thickening. Previously identified right lobe intrapulmonary opacity is redemonstrated image 67 of series 905, and lies at the fissural reflection just lateral to the postoperative scar. This measures 1.2 x 0.8 cm compared to 1.18 by 0.78 cm previously and has the appearance of a perifissural lymph node and is unchanged overall. There is mosaic pattern of attenuation of the bilateral lungs, new from prior. Pleura: No effusion. Heart: Mild cardiomegaly. Severe atherosclerotic disease of the coronary vessels. Aorta: Scattered mild atherosclerotic disease, mostly within the origins of the three-vessel takeoff. Mediastinum: Redemonstration of multistation mediastinal prominent in number and appearance lymph nodes. These are overall unchanged in size and appearance. However there is increase in size of the superior paratracheal lymph node, now measuring 9 mm across that short axis on image 66 of series 5, previously 5 mm across that short axis. Chest Wall: Degenerative disease of the visualized spine and shoulder. No axillary lymphadenopathy. Thyroid: Unremarkable. Esophagus:No hiatal hernia Upper Abdomen: Liver size and attenuation is normal. New right hepatic 1.6 cm hypoattenuating ill-defined lesion due to grainy appearance of the liver. Spleen size and attenuation is normal. There are layering gallstones present. The adrenal glands are normal. The kidneys demonstrate cortical thinning. The visualized pancreas is normal.

New diffuse thickening of the bronchioli/peribronchial cuffing as well as mosaic pattern of attenuation of the lungs, with differential diagnoses including early pulmonary edema versus bronchiolitis. 3. The main pulmonary trunk is dilated to 3.4 cm, which can be seen in pulmonary arterial hypertension. 4. Right chamber predominance cardiomegaly, likely related to above 5. New linear opacities within the left anterior lower lung lobe which can be related to scarring versus subsegmental atelectasis versus infectious process. Attention on follow-up is recommended. 6. Increase in size of superior right paratracheal lymph node from 4 to 9 mm. The remainder of the mediastinal lymph nodes are not significantly changed in size. Attention on follow-up is recommended. 7. New right hepatic 1.6 cm hypoattenuating ill-defined lesion . This can be a cyst. Correlation with ultrasound may be warranted. 8. Redemonstration of cholelithiasis without evidence of cholecystitis. Report E-Signed By: Adam Khalil at 2/14/2024 6:44 PM WSN:MHC1PACSDR04",

TECHNICAL DATA: Helical CT data through the chest after the uneventful intravenous administration of 75 ml of Isovue 370. Sagittal, and coronal reformats were created by the technologist. Post-processed, reconstructed multiplanar reformatted MIP images of the chest were also provided. All CT scans at this facility use dose modulation, iterative reconstruction, and/or weight based dosing when appropriate to reduce radiation dose to as low as reasonably achievable. FINDINGS: Mediastinum:Normal appearance of the thyroid. No mediastinal or hilar lymphadenopathy. . Opacification of the pulmonary arteries is appropriate for evaluation of pulmonary embolus on this exam. No pulmonary arterial filling defects are seen to suggest pulmonary embolus. The pulmonary arteries and thoracic aorta are normal in course and caliber. Upper limits of normal cardiac size. No pericardial effusion. Small hiatal hernia. Esophagus otherwise appears within normal limits. Lungs and pleura: Dependent atelectasis is noted in the bilateral lower lobes. Patchy nodular areas of consolidation are seen in the suprahilar and perihilar right upper lobe suspicious for multifocal right upper lobe pneumonia. No pneumothorax or pleural effusions. Peripheral pulmonary cysts versus paraseptal emphysematous changes of the left upper lobe are noted. No pneumothorax or pleural effusions. Normal appearance of the trachea and mainstem bronchi. Chest wall: No axillary lymphadenopathy. Normal appearance of the musculature of the chest wall. No soft tissue masses. Bones: No acute or suspicious osseous findings. Upper abdomen: Visualized portions of the upper abdomen are unremarkable. IMPRESSION: 1. No pulmonary embolus is seen. 2. Patchy nodular areas of consolidation are seen in the suprahilar and perihilar right upper lobe suspicious for multifocal right upper lobe pneumonia.

TECHNIQUE: Helical CT imaging of the chest was performed with 75 mL of IV Isovue-370. Multiplanar and MIP reconstructions were provided. All CT scans at this location are performed using dose modulation techniques as appropriate to a performed exam including the following: Automated exposure control; adjustment of the mA and/or kV according to patient size (this includes techniques or standardized protocols for targeted exams where dose is matched to indication / reason for exam; i.e., extremities or head); use of iterative reconstruction technique. DOSE: CTDIvol: 10.1 mGy DLP: 381 mGy-cm PROBLEM-SPECIFIC FINDINGS: PULMONARY VASCULATURE: Patent. LUNGS: Small consolidations in the posterior aspects of both lower lobes, right greater than left, are noted. There are additional groundglass opacities in the right upper lobe. PLEURA: No effusions or pleural plaques. ADDITIONAL FINDINGS: CHEST AIRWAYS: Patent. MEDIASTINUM: There are no pericardial effusions or any mediastinal lymphadenopathy. HILA: Normal. No adenopathy. UPPER ABDOMEN: Enteric contrast is noted to the level of the proximal descending colon. The upper abdomen is otherwise unremarkable. BONES: There are acute, isolated, minimally displaced fractures right third, fourth, and sixth ribs anterolaterally. Additionally, there is a very subtle contour irregularity of the left fifth rib anterolaterally that is suspicious for a nondisplaced fracture. Best demonstrated in the sagittal plane is a nondisplaced fracture of the mid sternal body (see sagittal series 904 image 204. Additionally, findings are suspicious for fracture of the right seventh chondral cartilage far anteriorly (axial series 900 image 257 and coronal series 902 image 42). Lack of significant surrounding inflammatory changes at this location, however, raise the possibility that this is appearance is normal for the patient. Moderate degenerative changes of the right shoulder are noted. LOWER NECK: The lower neck soft tissues are normal. SKIN/SOFT TISSUES: The skin and superficial soft tissues are normal. IMPRESSION: 1. The pulmonary vasculature is patent. There are no pulmonary emboli. 2. Multifocal consolidations in the posterior aspects of both lower lobes is most consistent with pneumonia. 3. Acute, isolated, minimally displaced fractures of the right third, fourth, and sixth ribs anterolaterally. 4. Very subtle contour abnormality of the left fifth rib anterolaterally is suspicious for an additional nondisplaced fracture. 5. Acute nondisplaced fracture of the sternum. 6. Lucency through the anterior aspect of the right seventh chondral cartilage is suspicious for cartilaginous injury. Report E-Signed By: Bennett Davis, MD at 2/15/2024 10:28 AM WSN:MHP1PACSDR07",

Representative images have been stored on PACS. One of the following dose optimization techniques was utilized in the performance of this exam: Automated exposure control; adjustment of the mA and/or kV according to the patient's size; or use of an iterative reconstruction technique. Specific details can be referenced in the facility's radiology CT exam operational policy. CONTRAST: 75 mL of IV Isovue-370. COMPARISON: Chest radiograph earlier on 2/16/2024, CT chest 12/23/2021 FINDINGS: CTA CHEST: Please note that this exam is optimized for assessment of the pulmonary arteries and is not intended as a diagnostic study of the thoracic aorta, coronary arteries or venous structures. Angiographic Findings: Pulmonary arteries: There are no filling defects in the main, right, left, lobar, segmental or visualized sub-segmental branches of the pulmonary arterial system. Other vasculature: Trace atherosclerotic calcification along the thoracic aorta without aneurysm. Additional non-angiographic findings: Lower neck: Negative. Lungs / Pleura: Small area of groundglass opacity and possible tree-in-bud nodularity in the inferolateral right lower lobe (series 7, image 100). Otherwise no evidence of consolidation. Borderline mild diffuse bronchial wall thickening centrally. No pleural effusion. A few micronodules appear stable compared to the CT chest from 12/23/2021. Mediastinum / Hila: Negative. Heart / Pericardium: Normal heart size. Multivessel coronary artery calcifications. Annular calcifications of the aortic valve. No pericardial effusion. Musculoskeletal / Body wall: Mild disc and endplate degenerative changes in the thoracic spine. Upper abdomen: Partially visualized post surgical changes in the upper abdomen including liver transplant. IMPRESSION: 1. No evidence of pulmonary embolism. 2.

            "answer": "CTA CHEST FOR PE GIVEN HISTORY: Pulmonary embolism (PE) suspected, high prob COMPARISON: Chest x-ray from earlier today; abdomen/pelvis CT of 11/15/2023. TECHNIQUE: Helical CT imaging of the chest was performed with 75 mL of IV Isovue-370. Multiplanar and MIP reconstructions were provided. All CT scans at this location are performed using dose modulation techniques as appropriate to a performed exam including the following: Automated exposure control; adjustment of the mA and/or kV according to patient size (this includes techniques or standardized protocols for targeted exams where dose is matched to indication / reason for exam; i.e., extremities or head); use of iterative reconstruction technique. DOSE: CTDIvol: 9.1 mGy DLP: 324 mGy-cm PROBLEM-SPECIFIC FINDINGS: PULMONARY VASCULATURE: Suboptimal bolus timing results in attenuation in the main pulmonary artery of approximately 150 Hounsfield units precluding detailed evaluation of the distal pulmonary arterial vasculature. There are no central, lobar, or segmental pulmonary emboli. LUNGS: There is dependent atelectasis. The chest is otherwise clear. PLEURA: No effusions or pleural plaques. ADDITIONAL FINDINGS: CHEST AIRWAYS: Patent. MEDIASTINUM: There are no pericardial effusions or any mediastinal lymphadenopathy. Soft tissue fullness about the distal esophagus reflects the paraesophageal varicosities that are seen to better advantage on the November 2023 CT. HILA: Normal. No adenopathy. UPPER ABDOMEN: At-Least-moderate volume ascites is redemonstrated. There is a nodular contour to the surface the liver noted in the context splenomegaly. Upper abdominal varicosities are redemonstrated. BONES: No aggressive lytic or blastic lesions. LOWER NECK: The lower neck soft tissues are normal. SKIN/SOFT TISSUES: The skin and superficial soft tissues are normal. IMPRESSION: 1. Suboptimal bolus timing limits this exam. There are no central, lobar, or segmental pulmonary emboli. 2. At-least-moderate ascites. 3. Paraesophageal varicosities and splenomegaly reflect portal hypertension. Report E-Signed By: Bennett Davis, MD at 2/18/2024 9:24 AM WSN:MHC1PACSDR04",

Imaging performed during the pulmonary arterial phase. 3-D MIP vascular multiplanar reconstructions were performed. CT rib reconstructions archived to PACS. All CT scans at this facility use dose modulation, iterative reconstruction, and/or weight based dosing when appropriate to reduce radiation dose to as low as reasonably achievable. COMPARISON: 10/15/2023 FINDINGS: Partially limited due to streak/beam hardening and quantum mottle. Pulmonary arteries: No large central or lobar filling defects detected. Main pulmonary artery enlargement may be seen in the setting of pulmonary arterial hypertension. Massive enlargement of the right main pulmonary artery, measuring up to 4.2 cm in diameter Heart: No pericardial effusion. Coronary artery disease. Borderline left atrial enlargement. Systemic vasculature: Aortic and branch vessel atherosclerotic change. Ascending aorta measures up to 3.7 cm in diameter. Lymph nodes: Negative for bulky lymphadenopathy. Other mediastinum: No acute abnormality. Lungs: Mosaic pattern attenuation may be secondary to air trapping and/or small airways disease. Partially limited due to various artifacts. Minimal soft tissue thickening at the hila and bronchial wall thickening. The Trachea and central airways: Patent. Bronchial wall thickening. Pleura: No pneumothorax. No pleural effusion. Bones: Multilevel spinal degenerative change. Advanced degenerative change of the right shoulder.. Soft tissues: No acute abnormality of the soft tissues included within the field-of-view. Abdomen: Not well evaluated due to artifact. Aortic and branch vessel atherosclerotic change. IMPRESSION: 1. Partially limited due to streak/beam hardening and quantum mottle No evidence of large central or lobar pulmonary embolism. 2. Massive enlargement of the right main pulmonary artery, measuring up to 4.2 cm in diameter. 3. Mosaic pattern attenuation may be secondary to small airways disease given bronchial wall thickening versus air trapping or heterogeneous pulmonary perfusion in the setting of pulmonary arterial hypertension. .

Imaging performed during the pulmonary arterial phase. 3-D MIP vascular multiplanar reconstructions were performed. All CT scans at this facility use dose modulation, iterative reconstruction, and/or weight based dosing when appropriate to reduce radiation dose to as low as reasonably achievable. COMPARISON: 1/28/2024 FINDINGS: Pulmonary arteries: No central or segmental filling defects detected. Main pulmonary artery enlargement may be seen in the setting of pulmonary arterial hypertension.. Heart: No pericardial effusion. Coronary artery disease. Right atrial enlargement. Reflux of contrast into the IVC. Systemic vasculature: Aortic and branch vessel atherosclerotic change. Lymph nodes: Nonspecific enlarged right hilar lymph node. Other mediastinum: No acute abnormality. Lungs: Mosaic pattern attenuation may be secondary to air trapping and/or small airways disease. Bronchial wall thickening. Punctate right lower lobe nodule on image 219, series 5. Subtle clustered groundglass nodularity in the lingula and right middle lobe. Trachea and central airways: Patent. Opacification of multiple distal airways with mild postobstructive atelectasis. Findings may be secondary to mucous plugging. Pleura: No pneumothorax. No pleural effusion. Bones: Subtle superior endplate deformities of T11 may be chronic. Compression deformities of the T12 vertebral body and L1 superior endplate. Soft tissues: No acute abnormality. IMPRESSION: 1. No evidence of central or segmental pulmonary embolism. 2. Mosaic pattern attenuation with diffuse bronchial wall thickening may be secondary to small airways disease. 3. Subtle clustered groundglass nodularity in the lingula and right middle lobe may be infectious/inflammatory, including atypical etiologies such as MAC. 4. Compression deformities of the T12 and L1 vertebral bodies are of indeterminate chronicity. 5. Posterior medial right upper lobe opacity distal to a partially opacified right upper lobe airway may represent postobstructive atelectasis and/or scarring; however, neoplasm is not excluded. .

TECHNIQUE: Pulmonary embolus protocol: Thin-slice axial imaging of the chest was performed during maximal pulmonary arterial opacification with intravenous nonionic iodinated contrast. Sagittal and coronal reformats and axial, sagittal, and coronal MIP series were performed to aid in pulmonary embolus detection. One of the following dose optimization techniques was utilized in the performance of this exam: Automated exposure control; adjustment of the mA and/or kV according to the patient's size; or use of an iterative reconstruction technique. Specific details can be referenced in the facility's radiology CT exam operational policy. CONTRAST: 60 mL of IV Isovue-370. FINDINGS: PULMONARY ARTERIES: The pulmonary trunk is normal in caliber. Pulmonary arteries are adequately opacified to the subsegmental level. There are no pulmonary emboli in the visible pulmonary arteries. THORACIC INLET: Normal. AORTA AND ARCH BRANCH VESSELS: No aneurysm or dissection. There is no atherosclerosis of the aorta. HEART/PERICARDIUM: The heart is normal. There is a trace physiologic pericardial effusion. There is no coronary artery calcification. MEDIASTINUM/HILA: Normal mediastinum. No lymphadenopathy. LUNGS/PLEURA: Small left and moderate right pleural effusions. Right pleural effusion has increased and the left has decreased in size. Bilateral pleural drains. Similar to the prior study are diffuse groundglass opacities and interlobular septal thickening.

Sagittal, coronal and slab 3D MIP coronal reconstructed images were also created for further evaluation and interpretation. Cross-sectional imaging of the abdomen and pelvis was obtained during venographic phase. Multiplanar reformats. One of the following dose optimization techniques was utilized in the performance of this exam: Automated exposure control; adjustment of the mA and/or kV according to the patient's size; or use of an iterative reconstruction technique. Specific details can be referenced in the facility's radiology CT exam operational policy. CONTRAST: Isovue-370, 100 mL COMPARISON: Chest radiograph from 2/19/2024, CT chest from 1/31/2024 FINDINGS: Heart/vessels: Heart size within normal limits. Dense coronary artery calcifications are identified. A left chest port terminates in the superior vena cava. No pericardial effusion. Aorta is normal in caliber. Evaluation of the pulmonary arteries demonstrates no evidence of pulmonary embolism. Mediastinum: No adenopathy. Mildly prominent hilar nodes. Lungs/pleura: Redemonstration of numerous pulmonary nodules, as before, which is not substantially changed since 1/31/2024. For instance, there is a 8 mm nodule in the right lower lobe on series 4 image 191. Other pulmonary nodules are also unchanged, for instance, a 2 mm right lower lobe pulmonary nodule on series 4 image 234 and a 3 to 4 mm right upper lobe pulmonary nodule on series 4 image 145.. No definite new pulmonary nodules. Mild bronchial wall thickening. Asymmetric left chest wall edema may be positional. No axillary adenopathy. Bones/soft tissues: Diffuse degenerative changes without acute osseous abnormality. Hepatobiliary: No focal liver lesion. Patent portal and hepatic venous systems. Spleen: Normal Adrenals: Normal Pancreas: Normal Kidneys: Compare with prior evaluation, there is stable left-sided hydronephrosis upstream of a focally enhancing apparent intraluminal mass within the left ureter measuring up to 9 mm. The downstream ureter is decompressed. Bladder is thin-walled. Prostate is normal in size. Small volume ascites. GASTROINTESTINAL: Appendix is normal. Again identified are numerous peritoneal masses with diffuse stranding within the mesentery, similar to slightly increased since prior exam. For instance, a left sided mesenteric mass measures 3.5 x 2.9 cm, previously 3.7 x 2.9 cm when measured similarly. Numerous other mesenteric nodules and masses are identified. Again there is diffuse gastric wall thickening with partially exophytic nodularity on series 6 image 121, similar to prior. Retroperitoneum: Scattered atheromatous calcifications in the abdominal aorta and branch vasculature. At least moderate SMA narrowing due to osteophytic plaque. There are enlarged retroperitoneal lymph nodes, for instance, a nodal conglomerate on series 6 image 184 which appears mildly increased in prominence since prior study. A periaortic lymph node measures 18 x 11 mm, previously 16 x 8 mm. No large vessel occlusion. Bones: Diffuse degenerative changes without suspicious appearing osseous lesion. Bilateral hip arthrosis. Scattered discogenic spinal degenerative changes. No evidence of fracture. Stable left scapular lytic lesion IMPRESSION: 1. No evidence of pulmonary embolism 2. Diffuse gastric wall thickening consistent with biopsy-proven gastric malignancy, similar to prior studies. Mesenteric stranding and peritoneal implants/adenopathy has mildly increased since prior study consistent with worsening metastatic disease. 3. Scattered small pulmonary nodules are stable in size, and a represent infectious inflammatory nodules versus malignancy. 4. Stable left scapular lytic lesion. 5. Apparent enhancing intraluminal mass in the proximal left ureter with associated mild left-sided hydronephrosis. Prostatomegaly. 6. Diffuse anasarca with small volume ascites.

Thyroid ultrasound October 30, 2023. FINDINGS: Neck: There is a right internal jugular vein chest port. There is a 3 cm nodule in the right lobe of the thyroid gland. There is another hypodense area that measures at least 2 cm. These nodules are better seen on previous ultrasounds. There is no retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy. Heart/coronary vessels: Negative. Pulmonary arteries: No filling defect to suggest pulmonary embolus. Thoracic aorta: Unremarkable without findings of dissection. Mediastinum: Negative. Lymph nodes: No axillary lymph nodes. Lungs/pleura: In the lung fields there are areas of focal and confluent groundglass density bilaterally. The most prominent findings are in the right upper lobe but there are noted in virtually every lobe. The findings could represent drug reaction, pneumonitis, atypical pneumonia or allergic alveolitis. Note that the patient has had groundglass densities in the past and correlation past medical history may be of benefit. Visualized upper abdomen: Marked hepatic steatosis. The gallbladder surgically absent. Bones/soft tissues: No sclerotic or lytic lesions noted. IMPRESSION: 1. No pulmonary embolus. 2. Focal areas of groundglass density throughout the lung fields as described above most prominent in the right upper lobe.

            "answer": "EXAM: CTA CHEST FOR PE CLINICAL DATA: Pulmonary embolism (PE) suspected, positive D-dimer TECHNICAL DATA: Contrast-enhanced CT pulmonary CT angiogram of the chest was performed with IV contrast. Multiplanar reconstructions were generated. All CT data was transferred to a 3D workstation for multiplanar reformation and 3D reconstruction under concurrent physician supervision. All CT scans at this facility use dose modulation, iterative reconstruction, and/or weight based dosing when appropriate to reduce radiation dose to as low as reasonably achievable. COMPARISON: February 19, 2024 FINDINGS: Scattered atherosclerotic calcifications including coronary artery calcifications. No filling defects in the main pulmonary arteries or segmental branches to suggest pulmonary embolism. No thoracic lymphadenopathy. No pleural effusion. Trace pericardial effusion. No acute lung abnormalities. Advanced paraseptal emphysematous changes. Basilar left lower lobe consolidation.. There are small nodular opacities within the left upper lobe, the largest measuring 5 mm, seen peripherally within the lingula (series 5 image 284). The central airways appear patent. Several left lower lobe segmental bronchi appear partially occluded. No acute abnormalities in the upper abdomen. No acute bone abnormalities. IMPRESSION: Impression: No evidence for pulmonary embolism. Partial occlusion of several left lower lobe segmental bronchi, which may be secondary to aspiration. There is an associated posterior basilar left lower lobe consolidation representing atelectasis or pneumonia. Small nodular opacities in the left lung, ranging up to 5 mm. -Recommend follow-up CT chest in 12 months. Consider yearly low-dose CT chest screening.

Sagittal, coronal and slab 3D MIP coronal reconstructed images were also created for further evaluation and interpretation. CONTRAST: Isovue-370 100 mls. One of the following dose optimization techniques was utilized in the performance of this exam: Automated exposure control; adjustment of the mA and/or kV according to the patient's size; or use of an iterative reconstruction technique. Specific details can be referenced in the facility's radiology CT exam operational policy. COMPARISON: None. FINDINGS: Neck: There is no supraclavicular lymphadenopathy. Heart/coronary vessels: Negative. Pulmonary arteries: No filling defect to suggest pulmonary embolus. Thoracic aorta: Unremarkable without findings of dissection. Mediastinum: No mediastinal or hilar lymphadenopathy. Lymph nodes: Negative. Lungs/pleura: There is bibasilar atelectasis, but in addition to this in the superior segment of the right upper lobe there is ill-defined groundglass density that is suspicious for an infectious process. In the left lower lobe there is also groundglass density on top of passive atelectasis suggestive of an infectious process. Aspiration could be excluded. Visualized upper abdomen: Small hiatal hernia. Bones/soft tissues: In the thoracic spine from T5-T10 there is superior endplate cavity with anterior cortical buckling and endplate sclerosis suggestive of subacute vertebral body compression fracture. Correlation clinical exam or MRI scan recommended for further evaluation. IMPRESSION: 1. No pulmonary embolus. 2. Groundglass density in the posterior segment of the right upper lobe suggestive of aspiration. There is bibasilar passive atelectasis as well; however, there is also groundglass density in the left lower lobe that is suggestive of aspiration pneumonia in the left lower lobe as well. Correlation clinical exam recommended. 3. Query subacute thoracic superior endplate fractures from T5-T10. Clinical correlation with past medical history or MRI scan recommended.

EXAM: CTA CHEST FOR PE CLINICAL DATA: Pulmonary embolism (PE) suspected, positive D-dimer TECHNICAL DATA: Contrast-enhanced CT pulmonary CT angiogram of the chest was performed with IV contrast. Multiplanar reconstructions were generated. All CT data was transferred to a 3D workstation for multiplanar reformation and 3D reconstruction under concurrent physician supervision. All CT scans at this facility use dose modulation, iterative reconstruction, and/or weight based dosing when appropriate to reduce radiation dose to as low as reasonably achievable. COMPARISON: Radiographs February 21, 2024 FINDINGS: Prior cardiothoracic surgery. Scattered atherosclerotic calcifications including coronary artery calcifications. No filling defects in the main pulmonary arteries or segmental branches to suggest pulmonary embolism. No thoracic lymphadenopathy. No pleural effusion. No pericardial effusion. No acute lung abnormalities. Dependent atelectatic changes. 10 mm subpleural posterior left lower lobe nodular opacity (series 7 image 176). 5 mm posterior subpleural right upper lobe nodule (series 7 image 149).

COMPARISON: CT chest, abdomen, and pelvis 1/16/2024. TECHNIQUE: Pulmonary embolus protocol: Thin-slice axial imaging of the chest was performed during maximal pulmonary arterial opacification with intravenous nonionic iodinated contrast. Sagittal and coronal reformats and axial, sagittal, and coronal MIP series were performed to aid in pulmonary embolus detection. One of the following dose optimization techniques was utilized in the performance of this exam: Automated exposure control; adjustment of the mA and/or kV according to the patient's size; or use of an iterative reconstruction technique. Specific details can be referenced in the facility's radiology CT exam operational policy. CONTRAST: 110 mL of IV Isovue-370. FINDINGS: Initial pulmonary arterial opacification was suboptimal and so the examination was repeated. PULMONARY ARTERIES: The pulmonary trunk is enlarged, measuring 3.2 cm in cross-section. Pulmonary arteries are adequately opacified to the subsegmental level. There are no pulmonary emboli in the visible pulmonary arteries. THORACIC INLET: Normal. AORTA AND ARCH BRANCH VESSELS: Ascending aorta measures 3.5 cm in cross-section. Not optimally opacified but no dissection within limits of the examination. There is mild atherosclerosis of the aorta. Mild atherosclerosis of the bilateral subclavian arteries. HEART/PERICARDIUM: The heart is normal. There is a trace physiologic pericardial effusion. There is mild coronary artery calcification. LUNGS/PLEURA/MEDIASTINUM: No pleural effusion. Stable posttreatment changes of the right lung and hilum with stable calcification and adjacent consolidation in the right lower lobe. Persistent cavitary lesion in the right upper lung with adjacent consolidation and bronchiectasis. There are new diffuse groundglass opacities throughout the lungs. No pneumothorax. UPPER ABDOMEN: Trace ascites adjacent to the inferior right lobe of the liver, new. Moderate amount of stool in colon. Mild atherosclerosis of the abdominal aorta. Splenic artery calcification. MUSCULOSKELETAL/VERTEBRA/BODY WALL: No acute abnormality. Stable multilevel spondylosis and C7 on T1 anterolisthesis. Stable chronic anterior wedging of T11-L1. Stable rightward thoracolumbar curvature. Stable lytic deformity and expansion of the posterior fourth left rib (image 23 series 21). The lytic lesion has improved from 2022 and may be due to treated malignancy/metastasis. IMPRESSION: 1. No pulmonary embolism. 2. New diffuse groundglass opacities throughout the lungs may be due to pulmonary edema or pneumonia. 3. Stable posttreatment changes of the right lung and hilum. 4. New trace ascites adjacent to the inferior right lobe of the liver. 5. The pulmonary trunk is enlarged. This is nonspecific but can be seen in the setting of pulmonary artery hypertension.

Sagittal, coronal and slab 3D MIP coronal reconstructed images were also created for further evaluation and interpretation. One of the following dose optimization techniques was utilized in the performance of this exam: Automated exposure control; adjustment of the mA and/or kV according to the patient's size; or use of an iterative reconstruction technique. Specific details can be referenced in the facility's radiology CT exam operational policy. CONTRAST: 45 mL of Isovue-370. COMPARISON: 2/25/2024. CT of the chest from 1/12/2022. FINDINGS: Heart/vessels: Contrast opacification within the pulmonary arteries is adequate. No pulmonary emboli are identified. There is no abnormal dilatation of the main pulmonary artery. No evidence of right heart strain. Stable 4.1 cm abnormal dilatation of the ascending aorta. Mild aortic atherosclerotic changes. There is cardiomegaly. Prominent coronary artery calcifications/stents. Mediastinum: Negative. Lymph nodes: Mediastinal adenopathy. Representative nodes include a 1.2 cm pretracheal node (6/32) and a 1.9 cm subcarinal node (6/52). There is fullness in both hila suggesting adenopathy. Lungs/pleura: There is concave deformity of the posterior wall of the trachea and the right and left mainstem bronchi resulting in luminal narrowing. This is consistent with tracheobronchomalacia. This is more pronounced than on the prior study. Paraseptal emphysema within both upper lobes. There is also focal honeycombing within the anterior right upper lobe.. Multiple bilateral groundglass opacities. Focally dense airspace consolidation within the anteromedial right upper lobe. Band of calcified pleural plaque again seen within the posterolateral mid right hemithorax. Visualized upper abdomen: Negative. Bones/soft tissues: Age appropriate spondylosis. IMPRESSION: 1. No pulmonary emboli. 2. Bilateral groundglass opacities and focally dense consolidation within the right upper lobe. These findings are most consistent with an infectious or inflammatory process. I suspect a multi lobar pneumonia and perhaps a right upper lobe bacterial pneumonia superimposed on a viral pneumonia. 3. Mediastinal and bilateral hilar adenopathy. This may be reactive. 4.

Specific details can be referenced in the facility's radiology CT exam operational policy. CONTRAST: Isovue-370, 50 mL COMPARISON: Chest radiograph same day FINDINGS: Heart/vessels: Heart size is within normal limits. Evaluation of the pulmonary arteries is adequate for determination of pulmonary embolism to the proximal segmental level where contrast bolus is not no longer dense dense enough diagnostically. There is no evidence of pulmonary embolism. Heart is mildly enlarged. Aorta and main pulmonary artery are normal in caliber. Normal three-vessel branch pattern to the aortic arch. Mediastinum: Mild distal esophageal wall thickening Lymph nodes: Small rounded lymph nodes in the mediastinum and hila are favored to be reactive. Lungs/pleura: Mild small airways thickening. There is no consolidative opacity. A right-sided fissural nodule on series 4 image 136 measures up to 7 mm. No pleural effusion or pneumothorax. Visualized upper abdomen: Mild discogenic degenerative changes. No evidence of fracture. Bones/soft tissues: Negative. IMPRESSION: 1. No evidence of pulmonary embolism to the proximal segmental level. 2. Mild distal esophageal wall thickening, correlate for esophagitis. 3. Mild small airways thickening, which can be seen with infectious or inflammatory small airways disease. 4. Right-sided fissural nodule measuring up to 7 mm. Per Fleischner Society guidelines, recommend follow-up as below: 5. Small rounded lymph nodes in the mediastinum and hila are favored to be reactive. ---------- FLEISCHNER SOCIETY FOLLOW-UP GUIDELINES FOR NEWLY DETECTED INCIDENTAL NODULES IN PERSONS 35 YEARS OF AGE OR OLDER. *These recommendations do NOT apply to lung cancer screening, patients with immunosuppression or patients with a known primary malignancy. SOLITARY SOLID NODULE If nodule size is 8 mm: * Low risk patient ? Consider CT at 3, 9 and 24 months (if no change), PET/CT, tissue sampling or a combination thereof. * High risk patient ? Consider CT at 3, 9 and 24 months (if no change), PET/CT, tissue sampling, or a combination thereof. LOW RISK PATIENT: Minimal or absent history of tobacco use and of other known risk factors. HIGH RISK PATIENT: Tobacco use, family history of lung cancer, upper pulmonary lobe location of nodule, presence of emphysema, pulmonary fibrosis, older age. MacMahon H, Naidich DP, Goo JM, et al.

Sagittal, coronal and slab 3D MIP coronal reconstructed images were also created for further evaluation and interpretation. One of the following dose optimization techniques was utilized in the performance of this exam: Automated exposure control; adjustment of the mA and/or kV according to the patient's size; or use of an iterative reconstruction technique. Specific details can be referenced in the facility's radiology CT exam operational policy. CONTRAST: Isovue-370, 80 mL COMPARISON: 2/26/2024 radiograph chest FINDINGS: CHEST WALL: There is diffuse supraclavicular adenopathy on the left, for instance, a dominant supraclavicular node on series 6 image 3:30 measures 3.3 x 2.1 cm. Breast and axilla are otherwise unremarkable. Heart/vessels: Heart size within normal limits. There is mild deviation of the heart into the right aspect of the chest. The aorta and main pulmonary artery are normal in caliber. Pulmonary artery is adequately evaluated to the proximal segmental level four PE. There is no evidence of pulmonary embolism. Mediastinum: There are numerous enlarged mediastinal and hilar lymph nodes, for instance, a nodal conglomerate on series 6 image 236 measuring 3.8 x 2.0 cm. The left hilum is obscured given left pulmonary consolidation. There are mildly enlarged right hilar lymph nodes. There is a large hiatal hernia. Lungs/pleura: Right lung demonstrates scattered areas of groundglass opacification in the base with linear atelectatic change in the right middle lobe. There are several small apical pulmonary nodules, for instance, a 4 mm nodule on series 6 image 285. There is dense left lung consolidation/atelectatic change with debris within the left mainstem bronchus on series 6 image 207. None of the bronchi of the left lung are aerated. There is heterogeneous opacification of the left lung with relative hypoenhancement of the superior left lung. There is a moderate left effusion. There appears to be a pleural-based mildly enhancing mass on the left on image 81 of series 6 measuring 4.5 x 3.8 cm. There is associated mild cardiophrenic adenopathy (series 6 image 85). Visualized upper abdomen: Probable hepatic steatosis. Remainder of the visualized upper abdominal structures are normal. Bones/soft tissues: Discogenic degenerative changes throughout the spine. No evidence of acute osseous abnormality. IMPRESSION: 1. No evidence of pulmonary embolism to the proximal segmental level. 2. There appears to be a mildly enhancing pleural-based mass on the left measuring 4.5 x 3.8 cm. There is associated bulky mediastinal adenopathy, likely hilar adenopathy, left supraclavicular adenopathy, and mild cardiophrenic adenopathy. Findings are concerning for malignancy. Recommend tissue sampling. The left supraclavicular lymph nodes would be accessible percutaneously. 2. Dense left lung consolidation/atelectatic change with debris within the left mainstem bronchus. None of the bronchi of the left lung are aerated. There is a moderate left effusion. Findings may be postobstructive due to endobronchial mass, mucus plugging, or compression from mediastinal adenopathy. Consider pulmonology referral for consideration of bronchoscopy.

Specific details can be referenced in the facility's radiology CT exam operational policy. CONTRAST: 80 mL of IV Isovue-370 COMPARISON: 1/19/2024 FINDINGS: Stable mildly enlarged subaortic lymph node is seen measuring 1.7 cm x 0.9 cm. There is no other mediastinal, axillary or hilar lymphadenopathy. No pleural or pericardial effusions are seen. The pulmonary arteries are patent with no intraluminal filling defects identified. There is no evidence of pulmonary embolus. However there is a left upper lobe mass which is narrowing the anterior branches of left upper lobe pulmonary artery. Left upper lobe paramediastinal suprahilar mass is seen measuring approximately 3.4 cm x 3.0 cm. This has increased in size when compared the prior study. Several left apical lung nodules are seen measuring 1.6 cm x 1.2 cm and 2.1 cm x 0.8 cm. Previously these measured 1.1 cm x 1.1 cm and 0.8 cm x 0.4 cm. Stable 2.3 cm opacity is noted in the right upper lobe adjacent to the fissure. Moderate emphysematous changes are seen. There is no pneumothorax. The airway is patent. The heart is normal in size. There are atherosclerotic changes of the aorta. There is compression fracture of T8 which has significantly progressed when compared with the prior study. Note is made of a stable 2 cm left breast mass. IMPRESSION: 1. No evidence of pulmonary embolus. 2. Progression of disease as there is an enlarging left upper lobe mass with enlarging left apical lung nodules. Moderate emphysema is noted. 3. Worsening compression fracture of T8.

CT chest, abdomen and pelvis performed 2/12/2024. TECHNICAL DATA: Helical CT data through the chest after the uneventful intravenous administration of 75 ml of Isovue 370. Sagittal, and coronal reformats were created by the technologist. Post-processed, reconstructed multiplanar reformatted MIP images of the chest were also provided. All CT scans at this facility use dose modulation, iterative reconstruction, and/or weight based dosing when appropriate to reduce radiation dose to as low as reasonably achievable. FINDINGS: Mediastinum:Normal appearance of the thyroid. No mediastinal or hilar lymphadenopathy. . Opacification of the pulmonary arteries is appropriate for evaluation of pulmonary embolus on this exam. No pulmonary arterial filling defects are seen to suggest pulmonary embolus. The pulmonary arteries and thoracic aorta are normal in course and caliber. Normal heart size. Normal appearance of the esophagus.. Lungs and pleura: New small bilateral pleural effusions with associated compressive atelectasis in the dependent lower lobes. No pneumothorax. Remainder the lungs are clear. Normal appearance of the trachea and mainstem bronchi. Chest wall: No axillary lymphadenopathy. Status post right mastectomy. Bones: Redemonstration of numerous lytic osseous lesions seen throughout the sternum, ribs and imaged portions of the spine, similar in appearance compared with prior imaging. Anterior compression deformities at T1 and T10 are unchanged in comparison with the most recent prior exam. Increasing vertebral body height loss is seen at L1 compared with prior imaging now with approximately 50% vertebral body height loss at this level with approximately 3-4 mm of retropulsion of superior endplate fragments into the central canal seen on this examination, also new compared with prior imaging. Upper abdomen: Visualized portions of the upper abdomen are unremarkable. IMPRESSION: 1. No pulmonary embolus is seen. 2. New small bilateral pleural effusions with associated compressive atelectasis in the dependent lower lobes. 3. Redemonstration of numerous lytic osseous lesions seen throughout the imaged portions of the spine, sternum, ribs and imaged portions of the spine, most consistent with the appearance of osseous metastatic disease. These findings are similar in appearance compared with prior imaging. 4. Anterior compression deformities at T1 and T10 are unchanged in comparison with the most recent prior exam. 5. Increasing vertebral body height loss is seen at L1 compared with prior imaging now with approximately 50% vertebral body height loss at this level with approximately 3-4 mm of retropulsion of superior endplate fragments into the central canal seen on this examination, also new compared with prior imaging.

Representative images have been stored on PACS. One of the following dose optimization techniques was utilized in the performance of this exam: Automated exposure control; adjustment of the mA and/or kV according to the patient's size; or use of an iterative reconstruction technique. Specific details can be referenced in the facility's radiology CT exam operational policy. Contrast: 90 cc of Isovue-370 COMPARISON STUDIES: CT 6/29/2022. FINDINGS: Please note that this exam is optimized for assessment of the pulmonary arteries and is not intended as a diagnostic study of the thoracic aorta, coronary arteries or venous structures. Angiographic Findings: Pulmonary arteries: There are no filling defects in the main, right, left, lobar, segmental or visualized sub-segmental branches of the pulmonary arterial system. Main pulmonary arteries enlarged measures 3.9 cm suggesting pulmonary to hypertension Other vasculature: Prominent coronary calcification. Postoperative changes noted from prior aVR. Descending thoracic aorta is markedly ectatic atherosclerotic. Proximal descending thoracic aorta measures 3.3 cm.. Additional non-angiographic findings: Lungs / Pleura: Small bilateral pleural effusions greater on the right. Bilateral groundglass opacities and interstitial prominence suggest fluid overload. Patient is a mild background of interstitial lung disease with subpleural interstitial nodularity and reticulation. 3 mm left for lobe micronodule (15/134) is stable. No further imaging follow-up per Fleischner criteria. Mediastinum / Hila: Postoperative changes from prior aVR and median sternotomy. Heart / Pericardium: Dilated right heart. Prominent coronary calcification. Prior aVR. Lymph node assessment: negative Musculoskeletal / Body wall: Left subpectoral chest wall lipoma. No visualized acute rib fracture. Patient is osteopenic. Sclerotic focus in the T3 vertebral body is stable Upper abdomen: negative IMPRESSION: 1. No evidence for pulmonary emboli to the subsegmental level. 2. Small bilateral pleural effusions. Scattered groundglass opacities and interstitial prominence suggest fluid overload. 3. Background of mild interstitial lung disease. 4. Numerous other chronic findings detailed above.

            "answer": "CTA CHEST FOR PE EXAMINATION: CTA of the chest with IV contrast History : V. Fib arrest, metastatic melanoma TECHNIQUE: Pulmonary embolus protocol - Thin-slice axial imaging of the chest was performed during maximal pulmonary arterial opacification with intravenous nonionic iodinated contrast. 3D coronal slab MIPs and 2D reconstructions in the coronal and sagittal planes were performed to aid in pulmonary embolus detection. Representative images have been stored on PACS. One of the following dose optimization techniques was utilized in the performance of this exam: Automated exposure control; adjustment of the mA and/or kV according to the patient's size; or use of an iterative reconstruction technique. Specific details can be referenced in the facility's radiology CT exam operational policy. Contrast: 50 cc of Isovue-370 COMPARISON STUDIES: CT abdomen and pelvis 12/31/2023, PET/CT 11/15/2023, CT chest 1/25/2008. FINDINGS: Please note that this exam is optimized for assessment of the pulmonary arteries and is not intended as a diagnostic study of the thoracic aorta, coronary arteries or venous structures. Angiographic Findings: Pulmonary arteries: There are no filling defects in the main, right, left, lobar, segmental or visualized sub-segmental branches of the pulmonary arterial system. Main pulmonary artery is dilated measures 3.7 cm suggesting pulmonary arterial hypertension. Other vasculature: Calcification of the coronary vessels. Mid ascending thoracic aorta measures 3.9 cm, ectatic.. Additional non-angiographic findings: Lungs / Pleura: Dependent consolidation in the upper lobes may indicate aspiration. No pneumothorax. Mediastinum / Hila: negative. Heart / Pericardium: Prominent coronary calcification. Lymph node assessment: negative Musculoskeletal / Body wall: Peripherally calcified bilateral breast implants. Bilateral intracapsular breast implant rupture, similar to prior. Extensive osseous metastatic disease throughout the spine, ribs and sternum. Nondisplaced fracture of the inferior sternum. Acute nondisplaced right anterolateral 4th rib fracture. Acute nondisplaced left anterolateral 4th and 5th rib fractures. Upper abdomen: 16 x 11 mm hypodensity segment 4 of liver previously measured 8 mm and is potentially metastatic and not characterized without contrast. IMPRESSION: 1. No evidence for pulmonary emboli to the subsegmental level. 2. Bilateral upper lobe dependent consolidation potentially aspiration. 3. Extensive osseous metastatic disease. 4. Acute inferior sternal fracture. Acute right 4th rib and left 4th and 5th rib fractures. 5.

Sagittal, and coronal reformats were created by the technologist. Post-processed, reconstructed multiplanar reformatted MIP images of the chest were also provided. All CT scans at this facility use dose modulation, iterative reconstruction, and/or weight based dosing when appropriate to reduce radiation dose to as low as reasonably achievable. FINDINGS: Mediastinum:Status post thyroidectomy. No mediastinal or hilar lymphadenopathy. . Opacification of the pulmonary arteries is appropriate for evaluation of pulmonary embolus on this exam. No pulmonary arterial filling defects are seen to suggest pulmonary embolus. Mild dilation of the main and central pulmonary arteries. Normal cardiac size. Dense mitral annulus calcification. No pericardial effusion. Post-CABG changes. Normal appearance of the esophagus.. Lungs and pleura: Small bilateral pleural effusions. Dependent atelectasis is seen in the inferior upper lobes and bilateral lower lobes. No pneumothorax. Normal appearance of the trachea and mainstem bronchi. Chest wall: No axillary lymphadenopathy. Normal appearance of the musculature of the chest wall. No soft tissue masses.

Sagittal, and coronal reformats were created by the technologist. Post-processed, reconstructed multiplanar reformatted MIP images of the chest were also provided. All CT scans at this facility use dose modulation, iterative reconstruction, and/or weight based dosing when appropriate to reduce radiation dose to as low as reasonably achievable. FINDINGS: Mediastinum:Normal appearance of the thyroid. Probably prominent subcarinal lymph node and bilateral hilar nodes are noted. The subcarinal node measures approximately 1.1 cm in short axis.. Opacification of the pulmonary arteries is appropriate for evaluation of pulmonary embolus on this exam. No pulmonary arterial filling defects are seen to suggest pulmonary embolus. The pulmonary arteries and thoracic aorta are normal in course and caliber. Normal heart size. Normal appearance of the esophagus. TUBES/LINES: Endotracheal tube tip lies approximately 3 cm above the carina. The enteric tube courses within the esophageal lumen and terminates within the proximal gastric lumen. Lungs and pleura: Mild-to-moderate pulmonary emphysema seen throughout the lungs, significant in the upper lobes. Dense consolidation is seen in the inferior left lower lobe with mixed interstitial and airspace opacities throughout the remainder of the left lower lobe. Additional nodular areas of developing consolidation are seen in the lingula and inferior left upper lobe, right lower lobe and inferior right upper lobe. No right or left pleural effusions. Dependent atelectasis is noted in the right lower lobe. No pneumothorax Normal appearance of the trachea and mainstem bronchi. Chest wall: No axillary lymphadenopathy. Normal appearance of the musculature of the chest wall. No soft tissue masses. Bones: No acute or suspicious osseous findings. Upper abdomen: Visualized portions of the upper abdomen are unremarkable. IMPRESSION: 1. No pulmonary embolus is seen. 2. Dense consolidation is seen in the inferior left lower lobe with mixed interstitial and airspace opacities throughout the remainder of the left lower lobe. Additional nodular areas of developing consolidation are seen in the lingula and inferior left upper lobe, right lower lobe and inferior right upper lobe. These findings are most consistent with multifocal pneumonia in the appropriate clinical setting. 3. Mild-to-moderate pulmonary emphysema, most significant in the upper lobes. Low dose CT lung cancer screening should be considered if this patient is not already enrolled in such a program. Report E-Signed By: Jason M Allen, DO at 2/28/2024 4:57 AM WSN:RICRADHOME11",

CTA chest performed 2/6/2024 TECHNICAL DATA: Helical CT data through the chest after the uneventful intravenous administration of 75 ml of Isovue 370. Sagittal, and coronal reformats were created by the technologist. Post-processed, reconstructed multiplanar reformatted MIP images of the chest were also provided. All CT scans at this facility use dose modulation, iterative reconstruction, and/or weight based dosing when appropriate to reduce radiation dose to as low as reasonably achievable. FINDINGS: Mediastinum:Normal appearance of the thyroid. No definitive mediastinal or hilar adenopathy is seen. Opacification of the pulmonary arteries is appropriate for evaluation of pulmonary embolus on this exam. No pulmonary arterial filling defects are seen to suggest pulmonary embolus. The pulmonary arteries and thoracic aorta are normal in course and caliber. Diffuse cardiac enlargement is again noted. Small to moderate pericardial effusion is also again seen, similar in appearance in comparison with the 2/6/2024 exam. Reflux of contrast material from the right atrium into the inferior vena cava and hepatic veins is again noted. Normal appearance of the esophagus. Lungs and pleura: No areas of consolidation are seen throughout the lungs. No pneumothorax or effusions. Normal appearance of the trachea and mainstem bronchi. Chest wall: No axillary lymphadenopathy. There is redemonstration of asymmetric thickening surrounding the nipple areolar complex of the right breast extending into the lower right breast which appears similar in comparison with the 2/6/2024 exam however, new in comparison with the 5/16/2023 exam. This finding is nonspecific and incompletely evaluated by CT. Postprocedural changes of both breasts are noted. The left breast shows no acute or suspicious findings. Bones: No acute or suspicious osseous findings. Upper abdomen: Visualized portions of the upper abdomen are unremarkable. IMPRESSION: 1. No pulmonary embolus or other acute cardiopulmonary findings are seen. 2. Redemonstration of diffuse cardiac enlargement and small to moderate pericardial effusion, similar in comparison with the 2/6/2024 exam. 3. Redemonstration of asymmetric thickening surrounding the nipple areolar complex of the right breast extending into the lower right breast which appears similar in comparison with the 2/6/2024 exam however, new in comparison with the 5/16/2023 exam.

Three-dimensional (MIP) reconstructions were performed. Three-dimensional coronal and sagittal MIP reconstructions were performed. CONTRAST: Isovue 370 60 mL COMPARISON: Same day chest radiograph, CT chest without contrast dated 11/30/2023 FINDINGS: CTA: Contrast bolus timing allows for adequate evaluation to the level of the segmental pulmonary arteries. There is a filling defect in the distal left inferior lobar artery extending into segmental branch (5/37, 902/183) suggestive of pulmonary embolus. No findings to suggest right heart strain. Thyroid: Visualized portions are unremarkable. Thoracic inlet: No supraclavicular adenopathy. Mediastinum and hila: Again seen multiple mediastinal hilar lymph nodes appear to have decreased in size, for example a subcarinal lymph node measuring 0.9 cm in short axis from previously 1.3 cm (5/31) and a right internal mammary node measuring 0.9 cm from previously 1.4 cm (5/24) when measured similarly. Thoracic esophagus is unremarkable. Heart and great vessels: Heart is enlarged. No pericardial effusion. Normal three vessel arch. Aorta and main pulmonary artery are normal in caliber. Mitral annular and aortic valve calcifications. Lungs, airway and pleura: Central airways are patent. Trace bilateral pleural effusions unchanged with adjacent dependent and subsegmental atelectasis. No pneumothorax. Diffuse scattered groundglass opacities and interlobular septal thickening. Redemonstrated multiple bilateral pulmonary nodules are overall similar, for example the index lesions as follows: - A solid nodule along the major fissure measuring 0.8 cm from previously 1.2 cm (6/157) - An unchanged 0.9 cm left upper lobe paramediastinal solid nodule (6/122). - Unchanged 6 mm nodule along the minor fissure (6/123). No definitely visualized new or enlarging nodules, although evaluation is limited by superimposed groundglass opacities. Breast and axilla: Similar right asymmetric breast tissue likely reflecting post lumpectomy changes (5/32) and left breast coarse calcifications. No axillary adenopathy. Interval decrease in size of right axillary node now measuring point 0.5 cm in short axis from previously 0.9 cm (5/19) and right retropectoral node measuring 0.7 cm in short axis from previously 0.9 cm (5/21). Upper Abdomen: Moderate hiatal hernia is overall unchanged. Innumerable liver lesions better characterized on recent PET/CT. No acute findings in the imaged abdomen. Bones/Soft tissues: Sclerotic foci involving T7 and T9 vertebral bodies. Unchanged sclerotic T11 vertebral body with compression fracture deformity, with approximately 50% height loss without significant retropulsion. Mild T6 compression fracture deformity is stable unchanged. IMPRESSION: 1. Acute pulmonary embolism involving the distal left lower lobar artery and extending into a segmental branch. No evidence of right heart strain or pulmonary infarct. 2. Metastatic disease in the mediastinum and lungs appears overall stable compared to 11/30/2023. 3. Again seen metastatic disease involving the axial skeleton and liver better characterized on recent PET/CT.

On anticoagulation with warfarin. COMPARISON: CT PE 10/19/2010. TECHNIQUE: CT angiography of the chest was performed with contrast bolus timing allowing for adequate evaluation to the level of proximal segmental pulmonary arteries using 100 mL of Isovue 370. Post-processing included the production of axial, coronal and sagittal multiplanar reformatted images and axial and coronal maximum intensity projections (MIPs). FINDINGS: Thyroid: Unremarkable thyroid gland. Thoracic inlet: No supraclavicular lymphadenopathy. Mediastinum and hila: No mediastinal or hilar lymphadenopathy. The thoracic esophagus is unremarkable. Heart and great vessels: There is opacification of the pulmonary arteries suspicious for evaluating for pulmonary emboli to the level of the proximal segmental pulmonary arteries. Due to suboptimal contrast bolus timing and respiratory motion artifact, evaluation of more distal pulmonary arteries is limited. Given this limitation, there are multiple small volume acute filling defects in the pulmonary arteries. Filling defects involving the lobar and segmental pulmonary arteries, for example: medial segment of the right middle lobe, posterior segment of the right lower, apicoposterior segment of the left upper lobe, and posterior segment of the left lower lobe . The main pulmonary arteries are mildly prominent, with transverse diameter of 3.3 cm. No definite evidence of right heart strain. No coronary artery calcifications. No significant pericardial effusion. Lungs, airways, and pleura: The central airways are patent. Dependent bibasilar atelectasis, likely related to poor inspiratory effort.

            "answer": "CTA chest for PE DATE OF EXAM: 2/9/2024 INDICATION: Pulmonary embolism suspected, high probability. TECHNIQUE: Using multidetector CT, contrast enhanced chest CT was performed with contrast in pulmonary arterial phase. Three-dimensional (MIP) reconstructions were performed. Three-dimensional coronal and sagittal MIP reconstructions were performed. CONTRAST: Isovue 370 100 mL COMPARISON: None FINDINGS: CTA: Contrast bolus timing allows for adequate evaluation to the level of the segmental pulmonary arteries. Extensive vascular wall calcifications along the main pulmonary artery with some extension to the left main pulmonary artery, may reflect postsurgical changes versus chronically altered flow dynamics in the setting of known underlying tetralogy of fallot. The left pulmonary artery is hypoplastic with an area of proximal stenosis with a minimal luminal diameter of approximately 0.3 cm (4/115). Just distal to this area of stenosis there is an eccentric filling defect along the pulmonary arterial wall probably chronic clot (902/173). No additional filling defects within the pulmonary arterial vasculature. Devices: Endotracheal tube terminates in the mid intrathoracic trachea. Enteric tube courses into the gastric fundus, below the field of view. Thyroid: In the inferior left thyroid there is a hypoattenuating nodule measuring 1.3 cm (902/141). Thoracic inlet: Nonspecific mild fat stranding the left greater than right superior mediastinal fat. No adenopathy. Mediastinum and hila: No mediastinal or hilar lymphadenopathy. The thoracic esophagus is unremarkable. Heart and great vessels: Normal size of the heart. There is some reflux of contrast into the IVC and hepatic veins. Area of nodular calcification near the aortic root and pulmonary artery root may reflect postsurgical changes (902/162). No significant pericardial effusion. The ascending thoracic aorta measures up to 4.1 cm. Lungs, airway and pleura: Some debris is seen within the distal trachea. Diffuse groundglass abnormality with some superimposed septal thickening. Also, there is some peribronchial thickening and areas of mosaicism. A nodule seen in the posterior segment right apical lung measuring 0.7 x 0.4 cm. Other scattered smaller nodules. No pleural effusion or pneumothorax. Breast and axilla: Visualized breast tissue is symmetric. No axillary lymphadenopathy. Upper abdomen: Visualized portions of the upper abdomen are unremarkable. Bones and Soft Tissues: There is mild degenerative change of the spine. Dextrocurvature of the midthoracic spine. No aggressive osseous lesion. Superficial soft tissues are within normal limits. IMPRESSION: 1. No acute pulmonary embolism. Scattered thick calcifications along the main pulmonary artery and left main pulmonary artery, which appears stenosed. Findings are likely related to underlying tetralogy of Fallot and postprocedural changes. Distal to the left main pulmonary artery proximal stenosis there is a tiny eccentric filling defect probably a focus of chronic clot. 2. Some reflux of contrast is seen within the IVC/hepatic veins which may be related to elevated right heart pressures, possibly due to pulmonary artery stenosis/or pulmonary valve insufficiency. However, RV:LV ratio is normal. Follow-up results of performed same day echo. 3. Scattered groundglass abnormality and septal thickening likely reflects pulmonary edema. However, a superimposed infectious/inflammatory process is a consideration. 4. Mosaic attenuation is seen throughout both lungs, which may be related to an underlying pulmonary arterial vascular abnormality or small airways disease. 5. Right upper lobe nodule on average measuring 0.6 cm. Consider correlation with outside prior exams if available to confirm stability. Otherwise, recommend follow-up CT in 6-12 months. Critical findings and impression #1 were discussed with Dr. Asare Yaa and Dr. Andrew Ormsby of the primary team at 10:26 AM to 2/9/2024, via epic secure chat at 10:27 AM to 2/9/2024.

No acute pulmonary embolism to the lobar level, question of chronic segmental/subsegmental pulmonary embolism in the right middle lobe versus poor contrast opacification. 3. Multifocal pneumonia in the right upper and middle lobes. 4. Extensive coronary calcifications. 5. Dilated pulmonary trunk, findings nonspecific, can be seen in setting of pulmonary hypertension. 6. Small bilateral pleural effusions. I have personally reviewed the images and agree with the resident preliminary report. ________________________________________________ This exam was interpreted by a University of Colorado School of Medicine radiology physician.

TECHNIQUE: Contrast enhanced chest CT performed during the injection of 65 ml of Isovue 370. Three-dimensional (MIP) reconstructions were performed. COMPARISON: Ultrasound from today. FINDINGS: Pulmonary arteries: No pulmonary arterial filling defect to the segmental level. The more distal pulmonary arteries are suboptimally characterized due to respiratory motion and bolus timing. Heart and great vessels: The heart is normal in size. Aorta, great vessels, and central pulmonary arteries are unremarkable. Mediastinum and hila: No enlarged mediastinal or hilar lymph nodes. Lungs and pleura: Small calcified left lower lobe granuloma. Bronchial walls are diffusely thickened. Mild mosaic attenuation appears within the lower lobes. There is a thick band of atelectasis within the right lower lobe superiorly. No consolidation. No effusion or pneumothorax. Thyroid (visualized portions): Normal. Thoracic inlet: Unremarkable. Chest wall: No enlarged lymph nodes.. Abdomen: Gallbladder is not well-visualized but appears to have diffuse wall thickening with some. Cholecystic fat stranding. A punctate focus of gas lies near the gallbladder fundus and may be within the lumen or extraluminal. There is some fat stranding around the porta hepatis as well. Probable left upper pole peripelvic cyst is partially imaged. Liver is diffusely low attenuating indicative of steatosis. Bones: No acute osseous abnormality or suspicious lesion. Mild degenerative change of the spine. IMPRESSION: IMPRESSION: 1. No acute pulmonary artery embolus to the segmental level. 2. Mild airway disease and scattered atelectasis. 3. Abnormal appearance of the partially imaged gallbladder with wall thickening, pericholecystic inflammation and punctate focus of gas near the fundus. This is suspicious for cholecystitis. The gas could be from infection or developing emphysematous cholecystitis. Recommend CT abdomen/pelvis to further evaluate as the gallbladder was poorly visualized on today's ultrasound. 4. Hepatic steatosis. Results were discussed with James Joseph Bauer, PAC via phone at 1/1/2024 7:49 PM by Dr. Colantoni. A read back of two patient identifiers and impression occurred.

CONTRAST: Isovue 370 100 mL COMPARISON: Chest radiographs dated 10/18/2022, right upper extremity ultrasound dated 1/26/2024 FINDINGS: VASCULATURE: Contrast bolus timing allows for adequate evaluation to the level of the subsegmental pulmonary arteries. Moderate burden central filling defects to the segmental and subsegmental levels involving all pulmonary lobes. RV/LV ratio of 1 and flattening of the interventricular septum.. Occlusive thrombus extends from the junction of the brachiocephalic veins into the right internal jugular vein reaching the C3 level superiorly. The right subclavian and axillary veins are also occluded which is better demonstrated on same day ultrasound. Thyroid: Bilateral hypoattenuating nodules measuring up to 2.0 cm on the right and 1.7 cm on the left. Thoracic inlet: Enlarged right supraclavicular node measuring at least 2.9 x 1.7 cm (5/14). Mediastinum and hila: No mediastinal or hilar lymphadenopathy. Small hiatal hernia. Heart and great vessels: Normal size of the heart. Moderate coronary artery atherosclerosis.

Mild abdominal aortic atherosclerosis is mildly narrows the origin of the right renal artery. Bones and Soft Tissues: There is mild degenerative change of the spine. No aggressive osseous lesion. Superficial soft tissues are within normal limits. IMPRESSION: IMPRESSION: 1. Moderate burden of pulmonary emboli bilaterally with the most proximal extent to the segmental level. Borderline RV/LV ratio and flattening of the interventricular septum possibly related to right heart strain. Echocardiogram is suggested for further evaluation. 2. Occlusive thrombus extends from the junction of the brachiocephalic veins into the right internal jugular and subclavian veins with the more distal right upper extremity involvement better demonstrated on same day ultrasound. 3. Bibasilar peripheral consolidations and left lower lobe confluent groundglass opacities which are nonspecific, though could reflect pulmonary infarcts. Additional considerations include multifocal infection and aspiration. 4. Mosaic attenuation of the bilateral lungs which is most commonly seen in infectious versus inflammatory small airways disease. 5. Small left pleural effusion. 6. Bilateral thyroid nodules measuring up to 2.0 cm. Recommend outpatient/nonemergent thyroid ultrasound for further evaluation. 7. Indeterminant right supraclavicular lymphadenopathy.

No p covid, hypoxic, PMH VTE TECHNIQUE: Contrast enhanced chest CT performed during the injection of 80 ml of Isovue 370. Three-dimensional (MIP) reconstructions were performed. COMPARISON: CT 12/13/2023 and 10/12/2023 FINDINGS: Pulmonary arteries: Pulmonary artery trunk remains dilated measuring up to 4.3 cm. The left and right main pulmonary arteries are dilated and there is tortuosity and dilation of the central pulmonary vasculature. No evidence for pulmonary artery filling defect to the segmental level with limited assessment of the subsegmental branches. There is a small filling defect within a subsegmental branch extending into the lingula (series 6 image 147 and series 9 and four image 263 with more distal contrast opacification in the atelectatic lingula). The subsegmental filling defect is partially along the sidewall. Heart and great vessels: Heart is upper limits normal in size. Mild cardiomegaly between the right and left atria is not well-defined but unchanged and not well assessed by CT for underlying ASD. Thinning of the left ventricular myocardium at the apex can be seen with prior MI. There is lipomatous infiltration of the intra-atrial septum. Aorta is not diagnostically opacified but has normal course and caliber with mild scattered atherosclerotic plaque. Mild coronary artery calcifications. Mediastinum and hila: Prominent mediastinal fat. Unremarkable esophagus. Tiny hiatal hernia. There is significant narrowing collapse of the distal trachea and bilateral mainstem bronchi. Lungs and pleura: Mosaic attenuation. Scattered bronchial wall thickening with secretions and mucous plugging lower lobe bronchi. Persistent collapse the right middle lobe and partial collapse of the lingula. Increasing atelectasis and consolidation in the right lower lobe. Similar left basilar/lower lobe atelectasis. No pleural effusion, or pneumothorax. Thyroid (visualized portions): Normal. Thoracic inlet: Unremarkable. Chest wall: No enlarged lymph nodes.. Abdomen: Lobular contour of the liver and marked imaged attenuation indicative of steatosis and chronic hepatocellular disease. Bones: Osseous structures are diffusely demineralized. Multiple old rib fractures right lateral eighth rib fracture slightly offset is new from the prior but fracture margins appear somewhat ill-defined suggesting healing fracture. Moderate/severe multilevel degenerative changes of the spine. IMPRESSION: IMPRESSION: 1. Suspect a subtle subsegmental pulmonary artery embolus within the lingula. This could be acute to subacute. 2. Increasing atelectasis and/or consolidation in the right lower lobe secretions occluded in several lower lobe bronchi from mucous secretions. Persistent collapse of the right middle lobe and partial collapse of the lingula. Similar left basilar atelectasis. 3. Severe narrowing of the distal trachea and bilateral mainstem bronchi indicative of tracheal bronchomalacia. 4. Dilated pulmonary arteries indicative of pulmonary hypertension. 5. Hepatic steatosis and sequela of chronic hepatocellular disease. 6. Right lateral eighth rib fracture is new from 12/18/2023. This is of uncertain age and could be due to subacute. Results were discussed with Dr. LEMERY via phone at 1/13/2024 2:01 AM by Dr. Colantoni. A read back of two patient identifiers and impression occurred.

No Was there a contrast or saline extravasation? No TECHNIQUE: Using multidetector CT, contrast enhanced chest CT was performed. Three-dimensional (MIP) reconstructions were performed. Three-dimensional coronal and sagittal MIP reconstructions were performed. CONTRAST: Isovue 370 75 mL IMMEDIATE ADVERSE EVENT: None COMPARISON: Same day chest radiograph, CTA chest for PE 4/5/2022 FINDINGS: CTA: Contrast bolus timing allows for adequate evaluation to the level of the segmental pulmonary arteries. There is no acute centrally occlusive or nonocclusive filling defect. Nonocclusive filling defect in the superior lingular segmental pulmonary artery appears more eccentric compared to 4/5/2022, suggestive of chronic pulmonary embolism. Thyroid and thoracic inlet: Suboptimally visualized secondary to beam hardening artifact from multiple enhancing collateral vessels and left upper chest wall cardiac device. No gross abnormality. Mediastinum and hila: Enlarged 1.8 cm right paratracheal lymph node (8/107), and enlarged 1.1 cm right hilar lymph node (8/130). Heart and great vessels: Normal caliber of the thoracic aorta. Dilation of the main pulmonary artery, measuring up to 3.3 cm in diameter. Pacer leads terminating in the right ventricular apex and cardiac venous system. Moderate biatrial enlargement. There are severe coronary artery calcifications. No pericardial effusion. Lungs, airway and pleura: The central tracheobronchial airway is clear. Lower lobe predominant moderate bronchial wall thickening. Redemonstrated scattered tiny calcified and noncalcified pulmonary nodules bilaterally. Band and platelike opacities in the bilateral lung bases, likely atelectasis or scarring. No focal consolidation or thorax. Trace bilateral pleural effusions. Breast and axilla: Symmetric multiple enhancing collateral vessels in the thoracic inlet and left chest wall. Severe bilateral gynecomastia. Unchanged 1.5 cm subcutaneous nodule in the left lateral chest wall, likely a sebaceous cyst. No axillary lymphadenopathy. Upper abdomen: Unchanged scattered hypoattenuating hepatic lesions. Scattered atherosclerosis. No acute abnormality. BONES AND SOFT TISSUE: There are mild degenerative changes of the spine. No aggressive osseous lesions. No acute soft tissue abnormalities. IMPRESSION: IMPRESSION: 1. No evidence of acute pulmonary embolism. 2. Chronic pulmonary embolus in the lingular segmental pulmonary artery, as seen in prior exam 4/5/2022. 3. Lower lobe predominant moderate bronchial wall thickening is nonspecific and may represent bronchitis, aspiration, or atypical infection. 4. Trace bilateral pleural effusions. 5. Redemonstrated mediastinal and hilar lymphadenopathy of indeterminate etiology. These could represent metastatic disease versus other inflammatory process. Recommend continued follow-up per oncologic protocol.

            "answer": "CTA CHEST FOR PE HISTORY: PE suspected TECHNIQUE: CTA chest with intravenous contrast attention to pulmonary arteries. Sagittal, coronal and slab 3D MIP coronal reconstructed images were also created for further evaluation and interpretation. One of the following dose optimization techniques was utilized in the performance of this exam: Automated exposure control; adjustment of the mA and/or kV according to the patient's size; or use of an iterative reconstruction technique. Specific details can be referenced in the facility's radiology CT exam operational policy. CONTRAST: Isovue-370, 75 mL COMPARISON: 1/22/2024 FINDINGS: Lower neck and chest wall: No supraclavicular adenopathy. Chest wall is unremarkable. No axillary adenopathy. Heart/vessels: Heart is normal in size. Coronary artery calcifications are identified. Main pulmonary artery is normal in caliber. Pulmonary opacification is adequate for determination of PE to the proximal segmental level. There is no pulmonary embolism to the proximal segmental level. There are dense atheromatous calcifications in an otherwise normal size aorta. Mediastinum: Mild mediastinal and bilateral hilar adenopathy. For instance, a subcarinal lymph node on series 5 image 242 measures 15 x 12 mm. The distal esophagus is mildly patulous. Lungs/pleura: There are patchy nodular opacities in tree-in-bud opacities in the left lower lobe predominantly. Nodular and tree-in-bud opacities also affect the posterior right upper lobe. Groundglass opacities are identified in the right base. There is mucus plugging of some of the airways of the left lower lobe. Diffuse bronchial wall thickening. Sella areas of abnormality have a nodular appearance, for instance, a 14 mm nodular area in the posterior right upper lobe on series 5 image 191. Visualized upper abdomen: Calcified foci are identified in the liver which are similar in appearance to prior study CT scan. Bilobed left renal cyst is unchanged. Adrenal glands are unremarkable. No hydronephrosis. Mildly prominent bile duct. Bones/soft tissues: Degenerative changes identified in the thoracic spine. Chronic appearing wedge deformity of L1. No evidence of acute fracture. IMPRESSION: IMPRESSION: 1. No evidence of pulmonary embolism to the proximal segmental level. 2. Patchy nodular opacities and tree-in-bud opacities scattered throughout the lungs as above but worst in the left lower lobe where there is more focal consolidation. Findings are most suggestive of multifocal pneumonia. Given the nodular nature of some of the foci, Non-contrast chest CT at 3-6 months is recommended. 3. Mild mediastinal and bilateral hilar adenopathy, possibly reactive. 4. Diffuse bronchial wall thickening with mucus plugging of some of the airways of the left lower lobe.

No Was there a contrast or saline extravasation? No TECHNIQUE: Using multidetector CT, contrast enhanced chest CT was performed with contrast in pulmonary arterial phase. Three-dimensional (MIP) reconstructions were performed. Three-dimensional coronal and sagittal MIP reconstructions were performed. CONTRAST: Isovue 370 60 mL COMPARISON: None FINDINGS: CTA: Adequate opacification of the pulmonary arterial tree. Hypoattenuating eccentric filling defects originating within the proximal left main pulmonary artery and distal right main pulmonary artery, most suggestive of chronic pulmonary embolism. More central appearing filling defect is noted within the right lower lobe medial basilar segmental branch (series 10, image 165). Otherwise, occlusive thrombus more distally within the medial and posteromedial basilar segmental and subsegmental branches. The main pulmonary artery is dilated up to 3.7 cm in Thyroid: Visualized portions are normal. Thoracic inlet: No supraclavicular lymphadenopathy. Mediastinum and hila: No mediastinal or hilar lymphadenopathy. The thoracic esophagus is unremarkable. Heart and great vessels there is severe enlargement of the right atrium with additional enlargement of the right ventricle, with reflux of contrast into the intrahepatic IVC consistent with right-sided elevated heart pressures. There is resultant mass effect on the left atrium secondary to markedly enlarged right atrium. Left ventricle is normal in size. Mild atherosclerotic thoracic aorta measuring up to 3.8 cm. No coronary artery calcifications. Lungs, airway and pleura: Central airways are patent. Patchy groundglass and consolidative opacities of bilateral lower lobes with more hazy groundglass within the upper lobes. Superimposed peripheral linear opacities within the upper lobes. Although this suggests atelectasis. No significant effusions. No pneumothorax. Breast and axilla: No axillary lymphadenopathy. Upper abdomen: Partially visualized moderate volume abdominal ascites. Further evaluation limited. Bones and Soft Tissues: Generalized chest wall anasarca suggesting third spacing of fluids. No acute bony or focal soft tissue abnormality. IMPRESSION: 1. Extensive eccentric-appearing thrombus originating within the left greater than right main pulmonary artery extending into bilateral lower lobes, all suggestive of chronic pulmonary embolism. However, central filling defect is noted within the proximal right right lower lobe medial segment. While this focus may suggest acute PE, this may also represent resolving/evolving PE. No priors available for comparison. 2. Severe right atrial enlargement as well as right ventricular enlargement and reflux of contrast into the infrahepatic IVC, all suggesting elevated right heart pressures. There is resultant mass effect on the left atrium with narrowing. 3. Main pulmonary artery is dilated up to 3.7 cm suggesting pulmonary hypertension. 4. Basilar predominant groundglass and linear abnormality, most suggestive of atelectasis and pulmonary edema. Small component of lower lobe pneumonia not excluded given appearance. 5. Generalized anasarca and partially visualized abdominal ascites suggesting third spacing of fluids.

No Was there a contrast or saline extravasation? Yes -Extravasation Type: Saline -Extravasation Amount (Please indicate type and amount i.e. 40 mL Saline, 60 mL Contrast): 30mL -Extravasation Site Right Forearm COMPARISON: CT PE 3/20/2023. Same-day chest x-ray. TECHNIQUE: Contrast enhanced chest CT performed during the injection of 60 mL of Isovue-370 according to PE protocol. Three-dimensional (MIP) reconstructions were performed. FINDINGS: CTA FINDINGS: Contrast bolus timing is adequate to rule out pulmonary embolus to the subsegmental pulmonary arteries. Mild increase in dilation of the main pulmonary artery compared to prior examination, measuring up to 3.2 cm, previously 3.0 cm. Acute pulmonary embolus in the right lower lobar pulmonary artery. OTHER FINDINGS: Thyroid: No nodularity. Thoracic inlet: No supraclavicular lymphadenopathy. Heart and great vessels: The dual-lead left chest wall cardiac pacemaker/AICD, with its leads terminating in the right atrium and right ventricle. Redemonstrated is cardiomegaly with four-chamber enlargement. Postsurgical findings of prior left atrial appendage occlusion. Mild atherosclerotic calcifications throughout the thoracic aorta and its large caliber branches. Dilation of the ascending aorta, measuring up to 4.0 cm in caliber (measured on series 8/image 61), similar to prior. Mediastinum: Mediastinal and hilar lymphadenopathy, similar to prior. For example, enlarged left paratracheal lymph node measuring 1.0 cm short axis (5/112). Lungs, airways, and pleura: Fluid layers within the right mainstem bronchus. Opacification of distal airways in the bilateral lower lobes as well as the right middle lobe.Scattered bilateral groundglass pulmonary opacities. Tree-in-bud nodularity in the peripheral right upper lobe (for example, series 6/image 134). Near complete collapse of the right lower lobe with severe atelectasis of the right middle lobe as well. Consolidation within the left lower lobe. Large right and small left pleural effusions with compressive atelectasis of the dependent lungs bilaterally. Of note, all of these findings are strikingly similar to prior examination on 3/20/2023. Chest wall and axillae: No axillary lymphadenopathy. Upper abdomen: Timing of contrast bolus limits evaluation of the upper abdominal solid organs and bowel. No acute intra-abdominal abnormality. Small hiatal hernia. Bones and soft tissues: Mild degenerative changes of the imaged spine. No acute or aggressive-appearing osseous abnormality. Mild diffuse soft tissue edema. IMPRESSION: 1. Congestion of acute on chronic pulmonary embolus in the right lower lobar pulmonary artery. Streaky filling defect proximal to the presumed acute pulmonary embolus component likely represent sequela of old PE/pulmonary webs. No evidence of right heart strain. Complete collapse of the right lower lobe in its evaluation for pulmonary infarcts. 2. Stable cardiomegaly with reflux of contrast into the IVC consistent with cardiac dysfunction. No dilated main pulmonary artery consistent with pulmonary arterial hypertension. 3. Groundglass opacities throughout the left upper lobe concerning for atypical infection, aspiration, nonspecific pneumonitis or pulmonary edema. 4. New tree-in-bud opacities in the left upper lobe concerning for aspiration or atypical infection. Scattered groundglass opacities. 5. New near complete collapse of the right middle lobe. 6. Secretions in the right mainstem bronchus and multiple distal airways concerning for aspiration. 7. Large right and small left pleural effusions, similar to prior. 8.

No TECHNIQUE: Using multidetector CT, contrast enhanced chest CT was performed with contrast in pulmonary arterial phase. Three-dimensional (MIP) reconstructions were performed. Three-dimensional coronal and sagittal MIP reconstructions were performed. CONTRAST: Isovue 370 60 mL COMPARISON: CT chest without contrast 11/8/2017, 5/26/2017 FINDINGS: CTA: Evaluation for acute pulmonary embolism is heavily degraded secondary to significant contrast admixture secondary to severe sluggish flow within the markedly enlarged pulmonary artery. Negative for acute pulmonary embolism to the level of the proximal lobar arteries. Significant eccentric hypodensity with associated calcifications within the right lower lobe pulmonary arteries suggesting chronic pulmonary embolism. Main pulmonary artery is enlarged up to 5.4 cm previously 4.9 cm on 11/8/2017. The right main pulmonary artery measures up to 6.1 cm and the left main pulmonary artery measures up to 4 cm. Thyroid: Visualized portions are normal. Thoracic inlet: No supraclavicular lymphadenopathy. Mediastinum and hila: No enlarged mediastinal lymph nodes. Soft tissue fullness of bilateral hila without definitive discrete adenopathy. Heart: Severe enlargement of the right atrium, as well as enlarged right ventricle consistent with increased right heart pressures. Left cardiac chambers normal in size. Normal pericardium. Normal caliber thoracic aorta up to 3.1 cm, unopacified for dissection evaluation, with mild atherosclerotic disease. Left anterior chest wall dual-chamber pacemaker with leads terminating within the right ventricle and coronary sinus. Lungs, airway and pleura: Central airways are patent. There is significant compression of the left mainstem bronchus extending into the left upper and left lower central bronchi secondary to mass effect from the enlarged left main pulmonary artery there is superimposed ill-defined left greater than right peribronchial soft tissue fullness. Masslike consolidation posteriorly within the left upper lobe measuring at least 11.8 cm in AP dimension by 4.9 cm in transverse dimension by 10.3 cm in craniocaudal dimension. This appears to respect the left major fissure without definitive extension across into the left lower lobe. More discrete 1.6 x 1.4 cm right lower lobe solid noncalcified nodule (series 6, image 311). Severe background emphysema with bullous change and vascular distortion, progressed since prior. There is ill-defined mid and basilar predominant consolidative opacities with associated septal thickening and reticulations, with greatest focus of consolidation in the left lung base. No pleural effusion or pneumothorax. Breast and axilla: No axillary lymphadenopathy. Upper abdomen: No acute findings. Bones and Soft Tissues: There is mild degenerative change of the spine. No aggressive osseous lesion. Superficial soft tissues are within normal limits. IMPRESSION: 1. Negative for acute pulmonary embolism to the level of the lobar arteries. 2. Marked pulmonary hypertension, with progression compared with 11/8/2017. CT findings suggesting chronic pulmonary embolism within the right lower lobe and likely left lower lobe. 3. Significant compression of the left mainstem bronchus secondary to the enlarged left main pulmonary artery superimposed on peribronchial soft tissue fullness. 4. Masslike consolidation posteriorly in the left upper lobe measuring 11.8 x 4.9 x 10.3 cm, which may represent postobstructive atelectasis, although underlying malignancy is not excluded. 5. Discrete 1.6 x 1.4 cm right lower lobe nodule suspicious for malignancy. 6. Ill-defined mid and basilar consolidative opacities and septal thickening suggesting organizing pneumonia. 7.

            "answer": "CTA chest for PE DATE OF EXAM: 2/9/2024 INDICATION: Pulmonary embolism suspected TECHNIQUE: Using multidetector CT, contrast enhanced chest CT was performed with contrast in pulmonary arterial phase. Three-dimensional (MIP) reconstructions were performed. Three-dimensional coronal and sagittal MIP reconstructions were performed. CONTRAST: Isovue 370 55 mL COMPARISON: None FINDINGS: CTA: Contrast bolus timing allows for adequate evaluation to the level of the segmental pulmonary arteries. Multifocal pulmonary emboli are seen, some of them peripheral, listed below: in the medial basal segment of the right lower lobe lung (6/220), right middle lobe lobar artery with medial basal segmental extension (6/59), distal right main pulmonary artery, with possible extension into the upper lobe (902/150) and the lingular segments of the left upper lobe pulmonary arteries (6/109). Additional small distal segmental pulmonary emboli are noted in the lateral basal segments of left lower lobe lung (6/173). The main pulmonary artery is massively enlarged measuring up to 4.9 cm. There is septal flattening and the RV measures 3.7 cm. The LV measures 3.7 cm and there is reflux of contrast into the IVC and hepatic veins. Thyroid: Visualized portions are normal. Thoracic inlet: No supraclavicular lymphadenopathy. Mediastinum and hila: A left paratracheal lymph node measures 1.2 cm (5/30). No additional enlarged mediastinal or hilar lymph nodes. Patulous esophagus. Heart and great vessels: Global enlargement of the heart severe coronary artery atherosclerotic calcification. Prominent aortic valvular and mitral annular calcifications. Potential left ventricular hypertrophy. No significant pericardial effusion. Normal size of the great vessels. RV: LV ratio: 1. Lungs, airway and pleura: The central airways are patent. No thickening and right upper lobe bronchiectasis. Mild diffuse groundglass abnormality with superimposed septal thickening. Superimposed small focal areas of consolidation, for instance in the posterior superior segment of the left upper lobe lung, there is a nodular opacity measuring 0.8 x 0.8 cm (6/87). Bilateral posterior compressive atelectasis. No suspicious pulmonary nodule. Moderate bilateral layering pleural effusions. Breast and axilla: No axillary lymphadenopathy. Upper abdomen: Visualized portions of the upper abdomen are unremarkable. Bones and Soft Tissues: There is mild degenerative change of the spine. No aggressive osseous lesion. Superficial soft tissues are within normal limits. IMPRESSION: 1. Bilateral pulmonary emboli as described, some of them acute in the right lower lobe, and some of them likely chronic as described signs of mild right heart strain. However, there is global cardiomegaly and marked enlargement of the main pulmonary artery which is suspicious for chronic pulmonary hypertension with associated/superimposed right heart failure. Recommend evaluation by the pulmonary vascular disease clinic at 720.848.5300. 2. Mild bilateral groundglass with interlobular septal thickening likely representing pulmonary edema. Small burden of bilateral nodular/consolidative opacities which may be related to pulmonary edema or an infectious process. Recommend attention on follow-up. 3. Moderate right greater than left pleural effusions. 4. Prominently patulous esophagus, which suggests an increased risk for aspiration.

Bones/Soft tissues: Multilevel degenerative change of the visualized spine. No aggressive osseous lesion. IMPRESSION: 1. Multiple bilateral pulmonary emboli involving the right upper and and right lower lobar arteries, left inferior lobar artery and segmental branches. No evidence of right heart strain or pulmonary infarct. 2. Cholelithiasis is again noted. There is air in the gallbladder lumen which may be due to gas containing rim calcified gallstones in the absence pericholecystic fluid/inflammation, wall thickening or bile duct dilation. Clinical correlation is recommended. Findings were discussed with Dr Tanner Muggli by Dr. Mouna Chebaane via Epic Secure Chat at 6:40 PM on 2/7/2024 with confirmed receipt of results.

            "answer": "CTA CHEST FOR PE HISTORY: Pulmonary embolus suspected. TECHNIQUE: CTA chest with intravenous contrast attention to pulmonary arteries. Sagittal, coronal and slab 3D MIP coronal reconstructed images were also created for further evaluation and interpretation. One of the following dose optimization techniques was utilized in the performance of this exam: Automated exposure control; adjustment of the mA and/or kV according to the patient's size; or use of an iterative reconstruction technique. Specific details can be referenced in the facility's radiology CT exam operational policy. CONTRAST: 50 mL Isovue-370 12/22/2023 COMPARISON: None. FINDINGS: Heart/vessels: No pulmonary embolus to the segmental level. Three-vessel coronary artery calcifications and/or stents. Mediastinum: Negative. Lymph nodes: Negative. Lungs/pleura: Left lower lobectomy. Increasing consolidation with volume loss and traction bronchiectasis in the mid left lung with increasing tree-in-bud nodularity throughout the left lower lobe. There is additionally increasing interlobular septal thickening as well as basal predominant subpleural groundglass in the right lower lobe. No pleural effusion or pneumothorax. Central airways are patent. Visualized upper abdomen: Negative. Bones/soft tissues: No acute osseous abnormality or suspicious osseous lesion. IMPRESSION: 1. No pulmonary embolus to the segmental level. 2. Increasing consolidative and tree-in-bud opacities in the left lung which is nonspecific but again may be related to evolving posttreatment related changes. 3. Increasing interstitial prominence throughout the right lung with areas of subpleural groundglass. This could be treatment related or may be seen with pulmonary edema. No pleural effusion.

INDICATION: Known PE, AC reversed d/t acute pontine hemorrhage, eval PE burden Was there a contrast reaction? No Was there a contrast or saline extravasation? No, . Per chart review, reportedly single subsegmental pulmonary embolism found at outside hospital, as described on CT CAP from 12/27/2023 at Centura Hospital, was subsequently started on eliquis. \"Left lower lobe segmental pulmonary emboli\". TECHNIQUE: Contrast enhanced chest CT performed during the injection of 55 ml of Isovue 370. Three-dimensional (MIP) reconstructions were performed. FINDINGS: PE findings: Within the left lower lobe lobar artery there is a ill-defined eccentric area of hypoattenuation (6/37 and 10/42) this continues more distally into the origin of the left posterior basal segments (6/45). No occlusive thrombosis visualized. The subsegmental branches are not well visualized (previously reported thrombosis in this region). Thyroid: Visualized thyroid gland is normal. Thoracic inlet: No supraclavicular lymphadenopathy. Mediastinum and hila: No mediastinal or hilar lymphadenopathy. The esophagus is not dilated. Heart and great vessels: Cardiac chambers are normal in size. The pulmonary trunk is mildly dilated measuring 3 cm. The ascending aorta measures 3.7 cm. Atherosclerosis along aortic arch. No aortic aneurysm. No pericardial effusion. Lungs and pleura: Small bilateral low-attenuation pleural effusions. Adjacent atelectasis bilaterally. Patchy groundglass opacities in the bilateral dependent lung parenchyma, right greater than left. The central tracheobronchial tree is clear. No suspicious pulmonary nodule, although evaluation limited due to atelectasis. Breast and axilla: No axillary or subpectoral lymphadenopathy. Bones and soft tissues: Moderate multilevel degenerative changes in the spine. No suspicious osteoblastic or osteolytic lesion. Upper abdomen: No acute abnormality in the partially imaged upper abdomen. IMPRESSION: IMPRESSION: 1. Nonocclusive eccentric intraluminal hypoattenuation within the left lower lobe lobar artery. This may represent a nonocclusive embolism versus poor opacification. The distal left lower segmental/subsegmental branches are not well opacified, which is site of reported embolus on 12/27/2023. 2. Patchy bilateral groundglass opacities in the dependent lung,, likely infectious/inflammatory etiology. 3. Small bilateral pleural effusions. 4. Dependent atelectasis with developing consolidation not excluded.

Layering secretions in the lower trachea. Left basilar mucus plugging. Persistent small peripheral consolidations of the bilateral lung bases. Increased density of the right lower lobe superior segmental subpleural opacity (7/155). Mild background mosaic attenuation could reflect air trapping or potentially perfusional abnormality due to the large burden of emboli. No pleural effusion. Breast and axilla: No axillary lymphadenopathy. Upper abdomen: Visualized portions of the upper abdomen are unremarkable. Enteric tube terminates in the gastric body. Bones and Soft Tissues: There is mild degenerative change of the spine. No aggressive osseous lesion. Superficial soft tissues are within normal limits. IMPRESSION: IMPRESSION: 1. Large burden of pulmonary emboli as central as the lobar level bilaterally. Mildly decreased burden of clot in the left upper and right lower lobes, consistent with treatment response. No new areas of thromboembolic disease identified. 2. Normal size of the right heart chambers, improved since prior exam. 3. Interval placement of inferior approach ECMO cannula terminating in the lower SVC. 4. Increased density of a right lower lobe superior segmental subpleural consolidation, likely an evolving infarct. 5. Persistent bibasilar consolidations may reflect atelectasis, aspiration, or additional areas of pulmonary infarct.

No Was there a contrast or saline extravasation? No. . IV contrast: 77 mL Isovue-370. Technique: Contiguous axial CTA images of the chest were performed after the administration of IV contrast. Post processed CTA MIP images of the pulmonary arteries were created and reviewed. The axial source images were also reviewed. IMMEDIATE ADVERSE EVENT: None Comparison: Chest x-ray dated 2/17/2024. Findings: Questionable mildly enlarged cardiac silhouette. There is flattening of the interventricular septum and asymmetric widening of the right heart chambers. Reflux of contrast into the IVC and hepatic veins. Advanced coronary atherosclerosis. Cannot exclude presence of a coronary stents. Mild calcification in the mitral valve. Mild calcifications in the aortic valve. Atherosclerosis in the aortic arch. Large irregularly-shaped lobulated conglomerate of simple fluid in the right epicardial region with largest lobule measuring up to 2.1 cm in short axis. Similar simple fluid density extends posteriorly, abutting the anterior aspect of the right middle lobe. It measures up to 3.6 x 1.9 cm, axial image 46 of series 5. Pulmonary artery caliber: Dilated measuring 3.7 cm. Large burden of pulmonary embolus extending from the distal aspect of the right main pulmonary artery into all three lobar branches with segmental and subsegmental extension throughout the right middle and lower lobes and segmental and subsegmental extension posterior segment of the right upper lobe. Moderate burden of pulmonary embolus extending involving the proximal left upper lobar branches as well as the segmental and subsegmental branches of the left lower lobe. Low lung volumes limit evaluation. Bibasilar dependent atelectasis. Faint peripheral groundglass opacities in the right lower lobe may represent developing pulmonary infarcts or may be related to atelectasis or atypical infection. Mosaic attenuation of the right lung consistent with PE. Streaky atelectasis versus scarring in the lingula. Pleural-based pulmonary nodule in the left lower lobe measuring up to 7 mm. There is no pneumothorax. There are no pleural effusions. Visualized portions of the upper abdomen demonstrate a small hiatal hernia. The visualized osseous structures are normal in appearance. IMPRESSION: Large burden right pulmonary emboli as above. Moderate burden left pulmonary emboli as above. Right heart strain with reflux of contrast into the IVC and hepatic veins consistent with cardiac dysfunction. Pulmonary arterial hypertension with dilated main pulmonary artery. Low lung volumes limit evaluation. Scattered mosaic attenuation of the lungs consistent with PE. Cannot exclude lower lobe developing infarcts. Multiloculated irregular shaped cystic structures in the right epicardial region. Differential considerations include bronchogenic cyst, pericardial cyst versus esophageal duplication cyst. Less likely consideration is necrotic epicardial lymphadenopathy. Evaluation is limited on pulmonary arterial phase imaging. Recommend nonemergent dedicated evaluation with contrast-enhanced CT chest (not PE protocol) or more accurate characterization..

            "answer": "CTA CHEST FOR PE DATE OF EXAM: 01/26/2024, 0931 INDICATION: . Pulmonary embolism (PE) suspected, high prob Was there a contrast reaction? No Was there a contrast or saline extravasation? No TECHNIQUE: Using multidetector CT, contrast enhanced chest CT was performed with contrast in pulmonary arterial phase. Three-dimensional (MIP) reconstructions were performed. Three-dimensional coronal and sagittal MIP reconstructions were performed. CONTRAST: Isovue 370 50 mL COMPARISON: CT chest dated 11/2/2022. PET/CT dated 10/18/2023 FINDINGS: CTA: Contrast bolus timing allows for adequate evaluation to the level of the segmental pulmonary arteries. Acute saddle pulmonary embolism with large burden of embolic disease extending into the lobar, segmental, and subsegmental branches of the left lower lobe, right upper lobe, right middle lobe, and right lower lobe. Enlargement of the right heart chambers with flattening of the interventricular septum and large volume of reflux into the IVC and hepatic veins. Thyroid: Atrophic versus absent. Unchanged coarse calcification along the right side of the trachea, partially visualized. Thoracic inlet: No supraclavicular lymphadenopathy. Mediastinum and hila: No pathologically enlarged mediastinal or hilar nodes. Mildly patulous esophagus. Heart and great vessels: No evidence of right heart strain, as above. No pericardial effusion. The main pulmonary artery is enlarged at 3.6 cm, similar to 11/2/2022. Normal caliber of the thoracic aorta with moderate burden of atherosclerosis. Internal mixing artifact within the aorta is likely related to phase of contrast. Lungs, airway and pleura: The central airways are patent with scattered mucous plugging of the bilateral lower lobe bronchi. Extensive pulmonary nodules throughout the lungs, greater in the lung bases, with multiple nodules measuring slightly smaller compared to 10/18/2023, including a 15 mm right lower lobe nodule (6/170) (previously 17 mm when measured similarly), or a 17 x 15 mm left basilar nodule (6/239) (previously 18 x 17 mm when measured similarly). New pulmonary nodules are not excluded given the extensive nature of the disease. Peripheral groundglass and consolidative opacities in the lateral right lower lobe are new from prior exam, slightly wedge-shaped, suspicious for pulmonary infarct (6/179). No pleural effusion. Breast and axilla: Visualized breast tissue is symmetric. No axillary lymphadenopathy. Upper abdomen: The gallbladder is significantly distended, new from prior exams. Bones and Soft Tissues: Unremarkable osseous structures. Superficial soft tissues are unremarkable. IMPRESSION: IMPRESSION: 1. Acute saddle pulmonary embolism with large burden of lobar, segmental, and subsegmental pulmonary emboli distally. Embolus is occlusive at the right interlobar pulmonary artery. 2. CT evidence of right heart strain, recommend correlation with echocardiogram. 3. Right lower lobe pulmonary infarct. 4. Hydropic gallbladder is new from prior exams, and acute cholecystitis or acalculous cholecystitis is not excluded. 5. Extensive pulmonary metastatic disease. Multiple of the larger nodules are slightly decreased in size compared to 10/18/2023. New pulmonary nodule is not completely excluded given the extensive disease. Dr. Schmidt discussed the first 3 impression points with Dr. HOFFMAN via phone at 1/26/2024 9:34 AM . Critical read back using two patient identifiers was performed.

            "answer": "CTA CHEST FOR PE HISTORY: Pulmonary embolism suspected. Positive d-dimer. TECHNIQUE: CTA chest with intravenous contrast attention to pulmonary arteries. Sagittal, coronal and slab 3D MIP coronal reconstructed images were also created for further evaluation and interpretation. One of the following dose optimization techniques was utilized in the performance of this exam: Automated exposure control; adjustment of the mA and/or kV according to the patient's size; or use of an iterative reconstruction technique. Specific details can be referenced in the facility's radiology CT exam operational policy. CONTRAST: 58 mL Isovue-370 COMPARISON: Same-day radiograph FINDINGS: Lower neck: Negative Heart/vessels: Heart size normal. No pericardial effusion. Mild coronary artery atherosclerotic disease. Adequate opacification of the pulmonary arteries. No pulmonary embolism. Mediastinum: Negative. Lymph nodes: Negative. Lungs/pleura: Central airways are clear. Mild biapical scarring. No focal consolidation, pleural effusion, or pneumothorax. Scattered areas of scarring or atelectasis. Few scattered pulmonary nodules. This includes a 2 mm right lower lobe pulmonary nodule (4/214), 2 mm right upper lobe pulmonary nodule (4/122), 3 mm right upper lobe pulmonary nodule (4/152), and 3 and the right lower lobe pulmonary nodule (4/262). Calcified granuloma in the left upper lobe. Visualized upper abdomen: Round fat-containing lesion anterior to the liver (6/92) with thin hyperdense rim and 1.6 cm. This is indeterminant and may be sequela of fat necrosis. Soft tissues: Negative. Bones:Degenerative changes of the shoulders. Multilevel degenerative changes of the thoracic spine. Chronic compression deformity of T12. IMPRESSION: 1. No pulmonary embolism. 2. No acute findings within the chest. 3. Multiple pulmonary nodules measuring up to 3 mm. 4. Rounded fat-containing lesion anterior to the liver measuring 1.6 cm is indeterminant, but is possibly sequela of fat necrosis. Compare with prior imaging of available to determine stability of this finding. If no prior imaging is available to consider 6 month follow-up CT to ensure stability. RECOMMENDATION Pulmonary nodule: No follow-up needed if patient is low-risk (and has no known or suspected primary neoplasm). Non-contrast chest CT can be considered in 12 months if patient is high-risk (Per Fleischner Society guidelines). Final Report E-Signed By: Chad Christensen at 2/22/2024 11:36 AM WSN:Amicrad40",

            "answer": "EXAMINATION: CTA CHEST FOR PE DATE: 02/13/2024, 1654 INDICATION: Pulmonary embolism (PE) suspected, recent DVT, now syncope. Was there a contrast reaction? No. Was there a contrast or saline extravasation? No. COMPARISON: None. TECHNIQUE: Contrast enhanced chest CT performed during the injection of 80 mL of Isovue-370 according to PE protocol. Three-dimensional (MIP) reconstructions were performed. FINDINGS: CTA FINDINGS: Contrast bolus timing is adequate to rule out pulmonary embolus to the subsegmental pulmonary arteries. Multiple bilateral filling defects, including a segmental branch of the left lower lobe (6/138, 144), right middle and lower lobar pulmonary arteries (6/158, 160), multiple downstream segmental and subsegmental pulmonary arteries in the right middle and lower lobes, as well as segmental and subsegmental pulmonary arteries of the right upper lobe (6/137, 110). Dilation of the main pulmonary artery, measuring up to 3.4 cm in caliber. OTHER FINDINGS: Thyroid: No nodularity. Thoracic inlet: No supraclavicular lymphadenopathy. Heart and great vessels: Mild cardiomegaly. No bowing of the interventricular septum. The ascending aorta is normal in caliber.Aberrant right subclavian artery. Mediastinum: Moderate hiatal hernia. Lungs, airways, and pleura: The central tracheobronchial tree is clear. Mild bilateral bronchial wall thickening. Moderate bibasilar atelectasis. No suspicious nodularity or findings concerning for pneumonia.No pleural effusion. No pneumothorax. Chest wall and axillae: Asymmetric focal nodularity of the left breast, for example nodule measuring 1.8 x 1.6 cm (series 8/image 27) and additional nodule measuring 1.8 x 1.9 cm (8/30). No axillary lymphadenopathy. Surgical/biopsy clips in the fibroglandular tissue of the right breast. Upper abdomen: Timing of contrast bolus limits evaluation of the upper abdominal solid organs and bowel. Prior cholecystectomy. Bones: Mild degenerative changes in the imaged spine. Benign hemangioma of the T3 vertebral body. IMPRESSION: 1. Multiple bilateral pulmonary emboli, within the lobar, segmental, and subsegmental levels on the right, and within the segmental pulmonary arteries on the left. Age-indeterminate dilation of the main pulmonary artery. No asymmetric right ventricular enlargement. 2. Asymmetric nodularity of the fibroglandular tissue of the left breast. Recommend follow-up with diagnostic mammography. 3. Aberrant right subclavian artery, creating a vascular ring around the esophagus, which can can result in patient symptoms of dysphagia. 4. Moderate hiatal hernia. Attending review: I have reviewed the resident preliminary report and agree with the findings. ________________________________________________ The critical findings were discussed with Dr. Amelia Derstine via telephone by Dr. Chelsea Life of radiology on 2/13/2024 5:45 PM after confirming two patient identifiers. ________________________________________________ This exam was interpreted by a University of Colorado School of Medicine radiology physician.

Three-dimensional (MIP) reconstructions were performed. Three-dimensional coronal and sagittal MIP reconstructions were performed. CONTRAST: Isovue 370 80 mL COMPARISON: Same day chest radiographs. CT chest dated 11/19/2021. FINDINGS: CTA: Contrast bolus timing allows for adequate evaluation to the level of the segmental pulmonary arteries, significantly limited in the lung bases due to respiratory motion. Focal filling defect of the right upper lobe posterior segmental pulmonary artery at a subsegmental branch points (series 6 image 136). No definite pulmonary artery visualized elsewhere, though there are multiple questionable filling defects in the lung bases and areas of significant respiratory motion. The right heart chambers are enlarged, increased compared to 11/19/2021. No significant reflux of contrast into the IVC. Thyroid: Visualized portions are normal. Thoracic inlet: No supraclavicular lymphadenopathy. Mediastinum and hila: Scattered prominent mediastinal and hilar lymph nodes, including a right hilar 11 mm node, likely reactive to the acute process. The thoracic esophagus is unremarkable. Heart and great vessels: Right upper extremity PICC tip terminates in the mid SVC. Enlarged right heart chambers, increased from 2021. No significant pericardial effusion. The main pulmonary artery measures at the upper limits of normal at 2.9 cm. The ascending aorta measures at the upper limits of normal at 3.9 cm. Mild burden of thoracic aortic atherosclerosis. Mitral annular calcifications. Lungs, airway and pleura: The central airways are patent. Multifocal patchy groundglass opacities with more patchy consolidation at the lung bases, now predominantly peribronchovascular distribution. Component of interstitial lobular septal thickening at the lung apices. Trace volume of left pleural fluid. Breast and axilla: No axillary lymphadenopathy. Upper abdomen: Surgically absent gallbladder. Nodular thickening of the left adrenal gland is unchanged from 2021, consistent with a benign etiology. Bones and Soft Tissues: Moderate degenerative change of the shoulders. There is mild degenerative change of the spine. No aggressive osseous lesion. Superficial soft tissues are within normal limits. IMPRESSION: IMPRESSION: 1. Small burden of acute pulmonary embolism in the posterior right upper lobe segmental/subsegmental branch point. 2. Enlargement of the right heart chambers is increased compared to 11/19/2021. Findings likely related to pulmonary hypertension. Acute right heart strain is not excluded, consider echocardiogram as clinically warranted. 3. Extensive bilateral groundglass and consolidative pulmonary opacities, consistent with provided history of COVID pneumonia.

No Was there a contrast or saline extravasation? No TECHNIQUE: Using multidetector CT, contrast enhanced chest CT was performed with contrast in pulmonary arterial phase. Three-dimensional (MIP) reconstructions were performed. Three-dimensional coronal and sagittal MIP reconstructions were performed. CONTRAST: Isovue 370 60 mL COMPARISON: Chest radiograph 2/21/2024, CT chest 6/28/2023 FINDINGS: CTA: Contrast bolus timing allows for adequate evaluation to the level of the subsegmental pulmonary arteries. Extensive bilateral pulmonary emboli involving all lobes with most proximal extent to the distal right main and distal left main pulmonary arteries. Main pulmonary artery trunk is dilated measuring 3.9cm, increased compared to 6/28/2023. Right ventricular dilation with RV/LV ratio greater than 1. Slight reflux of contrast into the intrahepatic IVC. The left pulmonary artery anastomosis appear slightly tortuous but patent. Thyroid: Visualized portions are normal. Thoracic inlet: No supraclavicular lymphadenopathy. Mediastinum and hila: Decreased size of multiple previously prominent mediastinal lymph nodes, for example a 5mm prevascular node previously measuring 11mm on 6/28/2023. Mildly patulous esophagus. Heart and great vessels: Increased RV/LV ratio as described above. No significant pericardial effusion. No thoracic aortic aneurysm. Mild coronary artery calcification. Lungs, airway and pleura: Postsurgical changes of left lung transplantation. Expiratory phase exam. The left bronchial anastomosis is patent. Hypoinflated left lung transplant, which remains clear consolidation. Redemonstrated extensive subpleural reticular opacities and traction bronchiectasis in the right lung. Patchy groundglass opacities throughout the right lung are likely related to expiratory phase and hypoinflation. No pleural effusion or pneumothorax. Breast and axilla: No axillary lymphadenopathy. Upper abdomen: Diffuse periportal edema in the liver, new since 6/28/2023. Bones and Soft Tissues: Stable moderate degenerative changes of the thoracic spine. No aggressive osseous lesion. Superficial soft tissues are within normal limits. IMPRESSION: 1. Extensive bilateral pulmonary emboli involving all lobes, with most proximal extent to the distal right main and distal left main pulmonary arteries. 2. Increased RV/LV ratio, main pulmonary artery trunk dilation, and slight IVC reflux of contrast, consistent with right heart strain. Diffuse periportal edema may also be related to right heart strain. 3. Changes of left lung transplant. Evaluation of lung parenchyma is limited due to expiratory phase imaging and hypoinflated lungs.

CONTRAST: Isovue 370 the mL COMPARISON: CT chest abdomen pelvis dated 1/28/2023 FINDINGS: CTA: Contrast bolus timing allows for adequate evaluation to the level of the segmental pulmonary arteries. New moderate burden of acute pulmonary emboli as central as the right main pulmonary artery (series 6 image 135) with involvement of the right middle lobar artery, right lower lobe subsegmental arteries, and left lower lobe lateral subsegmental branches. No CT evidence of right heart strain. Thyroid: Atrophic versus absent. Thoracic inlet: No supraclavicular lymphadenopathy. Mediastinum and hila: No mediastinal or hilar lymphadenopathy. Moderate hiatal hernia. Heart and great vessels: Right chest port tip terminates in the mid SVC. Normal size of the heart. Small to moderate pericardial effusion is increased from 1/28/2023. Normal size of the great vessels. Lungs, airway and pleura: The central airways are patent. New wedge-shaped consolidation at the right lung base distal to the right lower lobe subsegmental pulmonary embolus (6/243). Smaller dependent left basilar opacities. No suspicious pulmonary nodule identified. Trace left pleural effusion. Breast and axilla: Visualized breast tissue is symmetric. No axillary lymphadenopathy. Upper abdomen: Similar degree of moderate intrahepatic pneumobilia with partially visualized common bile duct stent. Numerous liver metastases are redemonstrated, better evaluated on prior CT chest abdomen pelvis background hepatic steatosis. Dilated main pancreatic duct appears increased from 11/28/2023, measuring 11 mm at the level of the pancreatic neck, previously 7 mm (5/276). Gastric sleeve postsurgical changes. Bones and Soft Tissues: Partial visualization of anterior cervical spinal fusion hardware. Moderate degenerative change of the spine. No aggressive osseous lesion. The bones are demineralized. Unremarkable soft tissues. IMPRESSION: IMPRESSION: 1. Moderate burden of acute pulmonary emboli, as central as the right main pulmonary artery. No CT evidence of right heart strain. 2. Right lower lobe pulmonary infarct. Smaller dependent left basilar opacities may reflect atelectasis or additional developing infarcts. 3. Dilation of the main pancreatic duct appears increased compared to 11/28/2023, though is suboptimally evaluated by CTA chest technique. Consider dedicated abdominal imaging and correlation with lab values. 4. Increased small to moderate pericardial effusion. 5. New trace left pleural effusion. 6. Liver metastases are not significantly changed within the field-of-view, though suboptimally evaluated by technique.

Final Report E-Signed By: Lucy Lester, MD at 2/25/2024 10:38 PM WSN:AMICRAD90 CTA CHEST FOR PE HISTORY: High probability for pulmonary embolism. TECHNIQUE: CTA chest with intravenous contrast attention to pulmonary arteries. Sagittal, coronal and slab 3D MIP coronal reconstructed images were also created for further evaluation and interpretation. One of the following dose optimization techniques was utilized in the performance of this exam: Automated exposure control; adjustment of the mA and/or kV according to the patient's size; or use of an iterative reconstruction technique. Specific details can be referenced in the facility's radiology CT exam operational policy. CONTRAST: 80 ml Isovue-370 COMPARISON: Chest radiograph dated 12/6/2023. CT neck dated 11/29/2023, 2/24/2024, 12/7/2023 FINDINGS: PULMONARY CTA FINDINGS: This is a diagnostic quality helical CT pulmonary angiogram. There are multiple small segments of eccentric linear nonocclusive thrombus involving the left upper lobe subsegmental arteries (series 5 image 158) as well as involving the left upper lobe subsegmental arteries (5/212, 5/145 5/138)). OTHER FINDINGS: Support Devices: None. Heart/Pericardium/Great Vessels: Cardiac size is mildly enlarged. No evidence of right heart strain. There is mild calcific coronary artery atherosclerosis. There is no pericardial effusion. There is mild thoracic aortic and branch vessel atherosclerosis, portions calcific. The main pulmonary artery is normal in diameter. Pleural Spaces: The pleural spaces are clear. Mediastinum/Hila: Numerous nonenlarged mediastinal and bilateral hilar lymph nodes are not significantly changed. Neck Base/Chest Wall/Diaphragm/Upper Abdomen: Large heterogeneous right thyroid gland is not significantly changed compared to the prior CT neck dating back to 11/29/2023. There is no supraclavicular or axillary lymph node enlargement. Limited imaging through the upper abdomen demonstrates a 2.5 cm intrahepatic cyst, for which no follow-up is needed. Cholelithiasis is noted. There is apparent focal thickening and enlargement of the pancreatic tail associated with surrounding fatty stranding and fluid. Degenerative change is present in the spine. Lungs/Central Airways: The trachea and central airways are clear. There is subsegmental atelectasis in the posterior lower lobes. A 1.5 cm subpleural left lower lobe nodule is identified (series 3 image 56). Additional pulmonary nodules are seen, including a 7 mm right lower lobe nodule (series 3 image 47), a 6 mm right lower lobe nodule (series 3 image 44), an 8 mm average dimension basilar right lower lobe nodule, and a 7 mm basilar right lower lobe nodule (series 3 image 69), as well as unchanged subsolid nodules in the right upper lobe measuring up to 9 mm in average dimension. A subsolid nodule in the left upper lobe measures 8 mm in average dimension (series 3 image 35). IMPRESSION: 1. Subacute to chronic appearing bilateral subsegmental pulmonary artery emboli, some of which were previously evaluated on the 2/24/2024 CT neck. No evidence of right heart strain. 2. Enlarged and thickened pancreatic tail associated with surrounding stranding, which may be related to pancreatitis although an underlying lesion is difficult to exclude. Recommend correlation with lipase and follow-up contrast-enhanced CT for further evaluation. 3. Multiple pulmonary nodules measuring up to 1.5 cm as described above, which may be infectious/inflammatory etiology. Recommend follow-up in three months. 4. Redemonstrated enlarged heterogeneous right thyroid gland that is not significantly changed compared to 11/29/2023. Consider further evaluation with thyroid ultrasound.

Thyroid: Visualized portions are normal. Thoracic inlet: No supraclavicular lymphadenopathy. Mediastinum and hila: No mediastinal or hilar lymphadenopathy. The thoracic esophagus is unremarkable. Heart and great vessels: Question mild right atrial enlargement. Remaining cardiac chambers normal in size. No significant pericardial effusion. Normal size of the great vessels. No significant atherosclerotic disease. Lungs, airway and pleura: Central airways are patent. Trace bilateral effusions with adjacent passive atelectasis. Additional minimal groundglass within bilateral lower lobes, exaggerated by mild expiratory imaging, also favoring atelectasis. No dense consolidation. No significant edema. No pneumothorax bilaterally. No suspicious nodules. Breast and axilla: No axillary lymphadenopathy. Upper abdomen: Pneumoperitoneum in the upper abdomen. Refer to dedicated imaging for further evaluation. Bones and Soft Tissues: There is mild degenerative change of the spine. No aggressive osseous lesion. Mild subcutaneous/intramuscular emphysema left lower anterior chest/abdomen. IMPRESSION: 1. Acute pulmonary embolism originating within the truncus anterior extending into anterior subsegmental branches. No CT findings of right heart strain. 2. Small bilateral effusions with adjacent passive atelectasis. 3. Partially visualized abdominal pneumoperitoneum, likely secondary to recent left nephrectomy. Findings were discussed with Erin Kimberly Main, MD on 2/24/2024 at 11:30 AM. CONTACT INFORMATION: This exam was interpreted by a University of Colorado School of Medicine radiology physician.

TECHNIQUE: Pulmonary embolus protocol - Thin-slice axial imaging of the chest was performed during maximal pulmonary arterial opacification with intravenous nonionic iodinated contrast. 3D coronal slab MIPs and 2D reconstructions in the coronal and sagittal planes were performed to aid in pulmonary embolus detection. Representative images have been stored on PACS. One of the following dose optimization techniques was utilized in the performance of this exam: Automated exposure control; adjustment of the mA and/or kV according to the patient's size; or use of an iterative reconstruction technique. Specific details can be referenced in the facility's radiology CT exam operational policy. CONTRAST: 75 mL of IV Isovue-370. COMPARISON: None available. FINDINGS: CTA CHEST: Please note that this exam is optimized for assessment of the pulmonary arteries and is not intended as a diagnostic study of the thoracic aorta, coronary arteries or venous structures. Angiographic Findings: Pulmonary arteries: There are no filling defects in the main, right, left, lobar, segmental or visualized sub-segmental branches of the pulmonary arterial system. Other vasculature: Mild atherosclerotic calcification of the thoracic aorta without aneurysm. Additional non-angiographic findings: Lower neck: Negative. Lungs / Pleura: Mild dependent atelectasis. No focal airspace consolidation. No pleural effusion or pneumothorax. Mediastinum / Hila: Negative. Heart / Pericardium: Heart size within normal limits. No pericardial effusion. Musculoskeletal / Body wall: Negative. Upper abdomen: Negative. IMPRESSION: No evidence of pulmonary embolism. No acute CT findings in the chest.

            "answer": "CTA CHEST FOR PE DATE OF EXAM: 02/22/2024, 1718 INDICATION: History of DVT, no longer on anticoagulation, presenting after loss of consciousness. New oxygen requirement and history of DVT of the left lower extremity. Clinical concern for pulmonary embolism. TECHNIQUE: Using multidetector CT, contrast enhanced chest CT was performed with contrast in pulmonary arterial phase. Three-dimensional (MIP) reconstructions were performed. Three-dimensional coronal and sagittal MIP reconstructions were performed. CONTRAST: Isovue 370 70 mL COMPARISON: Same day radiograph. FINDINGS: CTA: Contrast bolus timing allows for adequate evaluation to the level of the subsegmental pulmonary arteries. Bilateral filling defect involving the right and left main pulmonary arteries, right and left lobar arteries, most right and left segmental arteries, and multiple bilateral subsegmental branches. Thyroid: Visualized portions are normal. Thoracic inlet: No supraclavicular lymphadenopathy. Mediastinum and hila: No mediastinal or hilar lymphadenopathy. Mild segmental air in the esophagus. Heart and great vessels: Mild cardiac enlargement with interventricular septal flattening. No significant pericardial effusion. Normal caliber thoracic aorta. Main pulmonary artery is dilated measuring up to 3.3 cm (series 6, image 113). Lungs, airway and pleura: The central airways are patent. Scattered, predominantly left lower lobar groundglass opacities. Mild dependent atelectasis. No suspicious pulmonary nodule. No pleural effusion or pneumothorax. Breast and axilla: Mild gynecomastia. No axillary lymphadenopathy. Upper abdomen: Visualized portions of the upper abdomen are unremarkable. Incidental Bochdalek's hernia. Bones and Soft Tissues: Chronic appearing well-corticated osseous fragments along the T4 and T5 spinous processes likely reflect remote avulsion fractures. No aggressive osseous lesion. Superficial soft tissues are within normal limits. IMPRESSION: 1. Acute bilateral pulmonary emboli involving the left and right main pulmonary arteries and multiple lobar and segmental branches bilaterally. 2. Dilated main pulmonary artery and interventricular septal flattening suggestive of right heart strain. 3. Scattered, predominantly left lower lobar groundglass opacities are likely reactive inflammation. 4. Other chronic findings as detailed. I have personally reviewed the images and agree with the resident preliminary report. Findings were communicated by phone with Julie Winkle, MD (emergency medicine) by Alexis Sunshine, MD (radiology) on 2/22/2024 5:21 PM after confirming two patient identifiers.

TECHNICAL DATA: Helical CT data through the chest after the uneventful intravenous administration of 75 ml of Isovue 370. Sagittal, and coronal reformats were created by the technologist. Post-processed, reconstructed multiplanar reformatted MIP images of the chest were also provided. All CT scans at this facility use dose modulation, iterative reconstruction, and/or weight based dosing when appropriate to reduce radiation dose to as low as reasonably achievable. FINDINGS: Mediastinum:Normal appearance of the thyroid. No mediastinal or hilar lymphadenopathy. . Opacification of the pulmonary arteries is appropriate for evaluation of pulmonary embolus on this exam. Evaluation for pulmonary embolus beyond the distal segmental level of the pulmonary arterial branches is significantly limited throughout the lungs secondary to patient respiratory motion during this exam. No large central pulmonary emboli are identified. The pulmonary arteries and thoracic aorta are normal in course and caliber. Diffuse cardiac enlargement. No pericardial effusion. Large hiatal hernia. Esophagus appears within normal limits. Lungs and pleura: Attenuation of the lung parenchyma is limited secondary to patient respiratory motion during this exam. The density in the right paraspinal region seen in the medial apical right hemithorax on prior imaging corresponds to a prominent right subclavian artery. The finding described in the apical left upper lobe is summation of shadows on prior imaging. No mass or other suspicious findings are seen in the left lung apex by CT. No pneumothorax or effusions. Normal appearance of the trachea and mainstem bronchi. Chest wall: No axillary lymphadenopathy. Normal appearance of the musculature of the chest wall. No soft tissue masses. Bones: No acute or suspicious osseous findings. Upper abdomen: Radiodense gallstones are seen within the otherwise normal-appearing gallbladder lumen.

            "answer": "CTA CHEST FOR PE HISTORY: hypoxemia/ tachypnea TECHNIQUE: CTA chest with intravenous contrast attention to pulmonary arteries. Sagittal, coronal and slab 3D MIP coronal reconstructed images were also created for further evaluation and interpretation. One of the following dose optimization techniques was utilized in the performance of this exam: Automated exposure control; adjustment of the mA and/or kV according to the patient's size; or use of an iterative reconstruction technique. Specific details can be referenced in the facility's radiology CT exam operational policy. CONTRAST: 80 mL Isovue-370 COMPARISON: None. FINDINGS: Heart/vessels: Moderate to large volume of bilateral pulmonary embolus extending from the distal main pulmonary arteries bilaterally into all lobes with occlusive and nonocclusive components and numerous segmental and subsegmental branches. Right ventricle is dilated with an approximate RV: LV ratio of 2.0 with associated interventricular septal flattening. Mediastinum: Negative. Lymph nodes: Negative. Lungs/pleura: Multifocal bilateral predominantly peripheral areas of consolidation with some groundglass. Some of these are in areas of occlusive pulmonary embolus (such as within the anterior left upper lobe, series 4 image 62) while others appear to have patent pulmonary arteries such as in the left lower lobe (series 4 image 32). Mild mosaic attenuation of the lungs with few areas of basilar smooth interlobular septal thickening. No pleural effusion or pneumothorax. Central airways are patent. Visualized upper abdomen: Negative. Bones/soft tissues: Negative. IMPRESSION: 1. Moderate to large volume of pulmonary embolus extending from the main pulmonary arteries bilaterally with evidence of right heart strain. 2. Multifocal bilateral consolidations and groundglass, some of which represent developing pulmonary infarcts. Other areas are less certain, given apparent patency of supplying pulmonary subsegmental arteries, with differential including multifocal infection and neoplasm. 3. Mild pulmonary edema.

Report E-Signed By: Jeffrey Weissmann, MD at 2/5/2024 4:03 PM WSN:M-RAD020 CTA CHEST FOR PE HISTORY: Pulmonary embolism (PE) suspected, high prob One of the following dose optimization techniques was utilized in the performance of this exam: Automated exposure control; adjustment of the mA and/or kV according to the patient's size; or use of an iterative reconstruction technique. Specific details can be referenced in the facility's radiology CT exam operational policy. TECHNIQUE: CTA chest with contrast. 3D coronal slab MIPs and 2D reconstructions in the coronal and sagittal planes were also created. CONTRAST: 70 mL of Isovue-370 COMPARISON: None. FINDINGS: Vessels: Pulmonary vasculature is well-opacified with no filling defects noted to suggest a pulmonary embolus. Aortic arch is normal. No aneurysmal change. No dissection. Heart and pericardium: No coronary artery calcifications. Mediastinum and hilum: Negative. Lymph nodes: Negative. Lungs/pleura: Mild mosaic symmetric groundglass opacities in both posterior lung bases. Minimal change seen in the posterior inferior aspect of the right upper lung. Small 4 mm parenchymal nodules seen adjacent to the fissure in the mid anterolateral aspect of the superior segment of the of the right lower lung (image 47 series 5) No effusions. No distinct consolidative change. Visualized upper abdomen: Negative. Lower neck: Negative. Bones/soft tissues: Negative. IMPRESSION: 1. Negative CTA for pulmonary embolus. 2. Faint groundglass opacity changes in both lung bases. The overall appearance of the scout CT chest film when compared to the prior chest film from 1/5/2024 shows a distinct improvement in both lung fields compatible with resolution of the prior multi lobar pneumonia.

            "answer": "CTA CHEST FOR PE KAORU MOORE 1/7/2024 8:54 PM CLINICAL DATA: 86 years Pulmonary embolism (PE) suspected, high prob Clinical concern for pulmonary embolic disease. TECHNICAL DATA: Following dynamic intravenous nonionic contrast infusion, multiple axial helical overlapped CT images with multiplanar reconstructions were obtained. All CT data was transferred to a 3D workstation for multiplanar reformation and 3D reconstruction under concurrent physician supervision. All CT scans at this facility use dose modulation, iterative reconstruction, and/or weight based dosing when appropriate to reduce radiation dose to as low as reasonably achievable. COMPARISONS: None available FINDINGS: Thoracic inlet: No focal lesion in the visualized thyroid gland. No supraclavicular lymphadenopathy Mediastinum: No significant mediastinal or hilar adenopathy. Thoracic aorta: Atherosclerotic changes. Normal variant retroesophageal right subclavian artery. Pulmonary arteries: Nondilated. Motion limits evaluation of the lower lung fields, however there is bilateral filling defects in the segmental and subsegmental branches of the right middle lobe, right lower lobe, and left lower lobe. Some of the emboli demonstrate eccentric appearance is suggestive of chronic thromboemboli. No calcification present. Heart: Cardiac enlargement. No right ventricular strain. Upper abdomen: No acute process. Multiple hepatic cysts. Cholelithiasis. Lungs/Pleura: Small area of consolidation in the right lower lobe series 7/151. No pleural effusion or pneumothorax. Musculoskeletal: No acute osseous abnormality. Soft tissues: Soft tissues unremarkable. IMPRESSION: IMPRESSION: POSITIVE EXAM for pulmonary embolus. Motion limits evaluation of the lower lung fields, however there is bilateral filling defects in the segmental and subsegmental branches of the right middle lobe, right lower lobe, and left lower lobe. Some of the emboli demonstrate eccentric appearance is suggestive of chronic thromboemboli. No calcification present. The most proximal thrombus is located in the segmental branches of the right middle lobe and right lower lobe. No evidence of right ventricular dysfunction. No pulmonary infarct.

Sagittal, coronal and slab 3D MIP coronal reconstructed images were also created for further evaluation and interpretation. One of the following dose optimization techniques was utilized in the performance of this exam: Automated exposure control; adjustment of the mA and/or kV according to the patient's size; or use of an iterative reconstruction technique. Specific details can be referenced in the facility's radiology CT exam operational policy. CONTRAST: Isovue-370, 80 mL COMPARISON: Chest 1/30/2024 FINDINGS: Lower neck: No supraclavicular adenopathy. Based thyroid is unremarkable. Trace bilateral gynecomastia. No axillary adenopathy. Heart/vessels: Imaging evaluation is adequate for determination of pulmonary embolism to the proximal segmental level. There is no definite pulmonary embolism, although contrast opacification is somewhat suboptimal. Aorta is normal in caliber. Descending thoracic aorta is unremarkable. Mediastinum: No adenopathy. Mildly thick-walled distal esophagus Lymph nodes: Negative. Lungs/pleura: There are patchy groundglass opacities bilaterally with more focal nodular opacities, for instance, in the right upper lobe on series 8 image 126 measuring 2.1 x 1.8 cm. Wedge-shaped area of consolidation in the right lower lobe is identified on series 8 image 147. A right lower lobe nodular opacity measures 1.7 x 1.5 cm. There is mild bronchial wall thickening. Rounded subpleural nodule in the inferior left upper lobe on series 8 image 164 measures up to 11 mm. Visualized upper abdomen: Hepatomegaly with diffuse hepatic steatosis. Gallbladder is unremarkable. Spleen is normal in caliber. Left kidney is diminutive with nonobstructive stones measuring up to 5 mm. Pancreas is unremarkable. There is mild hilar fullness of the left kidney on series 8 image 325. Bones/soft tissues: Degenerative changes identified in the spine. No aggressive appearing osseous abnormality. IMPRESSION: IMPRESSION: 1. No definite pulmonary embolism, although contrast opacification is somewhat suboptimal. 2. Patchy groundglass opacities bilaterally with more focal nodular opacities in the right upper lobe and right lower lobe. Findings are concerning for multifocal pneumonia with infectious/inflammatory pulmonary nodules.. Given the rounded nature of some of these nodules, Non-contrast chest CT at 1-3 months is recommended. If nodules persist, subsequent management will be based upon the most suspicious nodule(s) (Per Fleischner Society guidelines). 3. Hepatomegaly with diffuse hepatic steatosis. 4. Left kidney is diminutive with nonobstructive stones measuring up to 5 mm. There is mild hilar fullness of the left kidney. Consider correlation with renal ultrasound. 5. Mildly thick-walled distal esophagus. Correlate for esophagitis. 6. Additional findings as above. Report E-Signed By: Kristofer Schramm at 1/30/2024 1:50 PM WSN:AMICRAD83",

TECHNICAL DATA: Helical CT data through the chest after the uneventful intravenous administration of 75 ml of Isovue 370. Sagittal, and coronal reformats were created by the technologist. Post-processed, reconstructed multiplanar reformatted MIP images of the chest were also provided. All CT scans at this facility use dose modulation, iterative reconstruction, and/or weight based dosing when appropriate to reduce radiation dose to as low as reasonably achievable. FINDINGS: Mediastinum:Normal appearance of the thyroid. No mediastinal or hilar lymphadenopathy. . Opacification of the pulmonary arteries is appropriate for evaluation of pulmonary embolus on this exam. No pulmonary arterial filling defects are seen to suggest pulmonary embolus. The pulmonary arteries and thoracic aorta are normal in course and caliber. Normal heart size. Normal appearance of the esophagus. Lungs and pleura: There is a 0.4 cm noncalcified nodule in the right upper lobe (image 69, series 6). Additional 0.4 cm noncalcified nodule seen in the left lower lobe (image 235, series 6. Additional 0.6 cm noncalcified nodule in the left lower lobe (image 272, series 6). 0.3 cm nodule in the peripheral left lower lobe (image 209, series 6). Additional noncalcified pulmonary nodule seen in the right middle lobe measuring 0.5 cm (image 248, series 6). Calcified nodules are seen in the medial right middle lobe. No pneumothorax or pleural effusions. No dense areas of consolidation are seen throughout the lungs. Normal appearance of the trachea and mainstem bronchi. Chest wall: No axillary lymphadenopathy. Normal appearance of the musculature of the chest wall. No soft tissue masses. Bones: No acute or suspicious osseous findings. Upper abdomen: Numerous calcified granuloma moderate seen scattered throughout the liver. Status post splenectomy. Remaining imaged hollow and solid organs of the visible portions of the upper abdomen show no acute or suspicious findings. IMPRESSION: 1. No pulmonary embolus or other acute cardiopulmonary findings. 2. Multiple noncalcified pulmonary nodules are seen throughout the lungs as above, the largest of which measures up to 0.6 cm in diameter. In a patient of unknown risk level with a solid nodule of 6-8 mm, recommend CT at 6-12 months. In a low-risk patient, then consider CT at 18-24 months. In a high-risk patient, if the nodule is stable at 6-12 months, recommend CT at 18-24 months. CITATION: MacMahon H, et al.

FINDINGS: Cardiovascular: Acute pulmonary emboli in the segmental and subsegmental arteries, within all lobes, most notably in the right middle lobe. The right ventricle to left ventricle ratio is greater than 1, indicative of right heart strain. No pericardial effusion. Mediastinum/Hilum/Lymph nodes: No lymphadenopathy. Lungs, airways, and pleura: Small right pleural effusion with compressive atelectasis. Rounded consolidation in the right middle lobe favored to represent a pulmonary infarct. Chest wall/bones/soft tissues: No acute abnormality. Imaged upper abdomen: Unremarkable. IMPRESSION: IMPRESSION: 1. Acute pulmonary emboli in the segmental/subsegmental arteries in all lobes. CT findings of right heart strain. 2. Right middle lobe infarct 3. Small right pleural effusion, probably reactive. The findings were communicated to Dr. Ashley Barash at 3:50 PM on 1/16/2024.

Post-processing was performed with creation of maximum intensity projection images (MIP). All CT scans at this facility use dose modulation, interactive reconstruction, and/or weight based dosing when appropriate to reduce radiation dose to as low as reasonably achievable. CLINICAL HISTORY: Follow-up pulmonary embolism. COMPARISON: 7/24/2023 FINDINGS: Study Quality: Degraded by quantum mottle artifact and poor contrast bolus timing such that subsegmental and segmental pulmonary emboli could be missed. Pulmonary arteries: Redemonstrated weblike embolus within the right lower lobar artery (series 17 image 174). Previously identified subsegmental pulmonary embolus at the left lower lobe is not definitely present on this exam, though visualization of the subsegmental pulmonary arteries is not possible on this exam. No acute central pulmonary embolus identified. The main pulmonary artery is not dilated. Thoracic inlet: No adenopathy. Axillae and thoracic wall: No adenopathy. Mediastinum: No adenopathy. Aorta: Non-dilated. Heart: Moderate to severe coronary artery calcifications. Central airways, lung parenchyma, and pleura: No central airway obstruction. No pleural effusion. Was a continuation of the pulmonary parenchyma. Upper abdomen: An incidental 2.6 cm renal lesion with attenuation 21-69 Hounsfield Units is seen in the mid left kidney (series 5, image 372). Musculoskeletal structures: Mild degenerative change of the spine without acute or aggressive lesion. IMPRESSION: IMPRESSION: 1. Degraded by quantum mottle artifact and poor contrast bolus timing such that subsegmental and segmental pulmonary emboli could be missed. 2. Redemonstrated chronic pulmonary embolus within the right lower lobar artery. Previously identified subsegmental pulmonary embolus at the left lower lobe is not definitely present on this exam, though visualization of the subsegmental pulmonary arteries is not possible on this exam. No acute central pulmonary embolus identified. 3. Mosaic attenuation of the pulmonary parenchyma which could be related to hypoinflation, though small vessel or small airway disease could have a similar appearance. 3. Left renal lesion measuring 2.6 cm has indeterminate imaging features, but is suspicious for neoplasm. Recommend further evaluation, preferably with MRI without and with intravenous contrast, or CT without and with IV contrast. Herts BR, et al.

            "answer": "CTA CHEST FOR PE HISTORY: Awoke with left arm pain. COMPARISON: None. CTA left upper extremity was performed at the same time as the current examination. TECHNIQUE: Pulmonary embolus protocol: Thin-slice axial imaging of the chest was performed during maximal pulmonary arterial opacification with intravenous nonionic iodinated contrast. Sagittal and coronal reformats and sagittal and coronal MIP series were performed to aid in pulmonary embolus detection. One of the following dose optimization techniques was utilized in the performance of this exam: Automated exposure control; adjustment of the mA and/or kV according to the patient's size; or use of an iterative reconstruction technique. Specific details can be referenced in the facility's radiology CT exam operational policy. CONTRAST: 180 mL of IV Isovue-370. FINDINGS: Motion degraded. PULMONARY ARTERIES: The pulmonary trunk is normal in caliber. Pulmonary arteries are adequately opacified to the subsegmental level. There are pulmonary emboli at the bifurcation of the bilateral right and left pulmonary arteries, within the bilateral interlobar pulmonary arteries, and extending into the right and left upper and right lower lobe segmental and subsegmental and right middle lobe segmental pulmonary arteries. THORACIC INLET: 6 mm right upper thyroid nodule. AORTA AND ARCH BRANCH VESSELS: No aneurysm or dissection. There is mild atherosclerosis of the aorta. Mild atherosclerosis of the proximal left subclavian artery causes 25 percent stenosis. Left subclavian artery thrombus (image 13 series 5), better appreciated on the concurrent CTA of the left upper extremity. There is adjacent stranding. HEART/PERICARDIUM: The heart is enlarged. Motion degraded, but potential atrial septal defect (184-194 series 7). There is no pericardial effusion. There is no coronary artery calcification. The RV/LV ratio is 1.4. MEDIASTINUM/HILA: Normal mediastinum. No lymphadenopathy. LUNGS/PLEURA: No pleural effusion. Mild atelectasis. Mild emphysema. No pneumothorax. The airways are normal. UPPER ABDOMEN: Normal. MUSCULOSKELETAL/VERTEBRA/BODY WALL: No acute abnormality. Bilateral moderate to severe glenohumeral osteoarthritis with spurring of the humeral heads. Mild spondylosis. Partial T9-10 ankylosis, stable. Chronic concave deformities of the T2-T6 superior endplates, greatest at T3 and T5, stable. A Schmorl node deforms the T12, superior endplate, stable. IMPRESSION: IMPRESSION: 1. Bilateral pulmonary emboli. 2. The RV/LV ratio is 1.4, indicating right heart strain. 3. Left subclavian artery thrombus with adjacent stranding, better appreciated on the concurrent CTA of the left upper extremity. 4. Motion degraded, but potential atrial septal defect. This can be further evaluated with echocardiography as clinically indicated. 5. Other chronic findings as above. Findings of bilateral pulmonary emboli and right heart strain were discussed by phone with JACLYN BARBOUR WALKER on 1/6/2024 12:54 AM.

            "answer": "CTA CHEST FOR PE EXAMINATION: CTA of the chest with IV contrast History : History of pulmonary embolism, worsening clinical statement TECHNIQUE: Pulmonary embolus protocol - Thin-slice axial imaging of the chest was performed during maximal pulmonary arterial opacification with intravenous nonionic iodinated contrast. 3D coronal slab MIPs and 2D reconstructions in the coronal and sagittal planes were performed to aid in pulmonary embolus detection. Representative images have been stored on PACS. One of the following dose optimization techniques was utilized in the performance of this exam: Automated exposure control; adjustment of the mA and/or kV according to the patient's size; or use of an iterative reconstruction technique. Specific details can be referenced in the facility's radiology CT exam operational policy. Contrast: 90 cc of Isovue-370 COMPARISON STUDIES: 2/20/2024 as well as priors. FINDINGS: Please note that this exam is optimized for assessment of the pulmonary arteries and is not intended as a diagnostic study of the thoracic aorta, coronary arteries or venous structures. Angiographic Findings: Pulmonary arteries: Reidentified is a small right lower lobe subsegmental pulmonary embolism (18/160), unchanged from prior examination. The right lower lobe pleural-based nodule previously described is still present measures 9 mm and is partially obscured by the effusion could represent a small infarct. No evidence for right heart strain. Other vasculature: negative. Additional non-angiographic findings: Lungs / Pleura: Small pleural effusions greater on the right new from prior exam. Mediastinum / Hila: negative. Heart / Pericardium: negative. Lymph node assessment: negative Musculoskeletal / Body wall: Prior cervical fusion Upper abdomen: Will be described separately IMPRESSION: 1. Stable small right lower lobe subsegmental pulmonary embolism. No evidence for right heart strain. Previously described right lower lobe nodule/pulmonary infarct is once again noted but partially obscured by the pleural effusion. 2. Small bilateral pleural effusions greater on the right new from prior examination. Report E-Signed By: Thomas Dunphy, MD at 2/23/2024 11:07 AM WSN:AMICRAD14",

COMPARISON: 11/12/2023 FINDINGS: Pulmonary arteries: No large central filling defects detected. Partially limited due to likely suboptimal cardiac output. Main pulmonary artery enlargement may be seen in the setting of pulmonary arterial hypertension.. Heart: Market cardiomegaly. Filling defects in the right ventricle. The left ventral is not well opacified. Reflux of contrast into the IVC and hepatic veins may be secondary to primary cardiac etiology. Systemic vasculature: Limited evaluation. Lymph nodes: Borderline mediastinal lymph nodes. Other mediastinum: Small hiatal hernia. Lungs: Multifocal subsegmental atelectasis. Mosaic pattern attenuation of the lung bases bilaterally may be related to heterogeneous pulmonary perfusion or small airways disease given bronchial wall thickening. Bronchial wall thickening. Trachea and central airways: Patent. Bronchial wall thickening. Pleura: No pneumothorax. No pleural effusion. Bones: Bony structures without acute displaced fracture.. Soft tissues: No acute abnormality within the field-of-view. Abdomen: Subtle partially visualized mesenteric stranding may be secondary to increased volume status. IMPRESSION: IMPRESSION: 1. No evidence of large central or occlusive lobar pulmonary embolism. Partially limited due to suboptimal opacification likely from impaired cardiac function. 2. Massive cardiomegaly. Filling defects in the right ventricle. Thrombus in the are not excluded. Recommend echocardiogram for further evaluation. 3. Mosaic pattern attenuation and bronchial wall thickening may be secondary to small airways disease. 4. Pulmonary arterial enlargement may be seen in the setting of pulmonary arterial hypertension. 5. Minimal subtle smooth interlobular septal thickening may be secondary to mild volume overload. Findings discussed with Kaitlin Womeldorf, PA via phone at 7:44 PM, 1/4/2024. .

Report E-Signed By: Joseph Carabetta at 1/25/2024 2:52 PM WSN:AMICRAD25 ADDENDUM: Pulmonary embolism findings discussed with covering physician by telephone on 8:21 AM. Report E-Signed By: Joseph Carabetta at 12/29/2023 8:34 AM WSN:AMICRAD25 CT ABDOMEN/PELVIS WITH CONTRAST, CTA CHEST FOR PE, CT BRAIN WITHOUT CONTRAST COMPARISON: None. HISTORY: Abdominal pain, acute, nonlocalized. Head trauma, minor. Pulmonary embolism suspected unknown d-dimer. TECHNIQUE: Axial noncontrast CT brain with coronal and sagittal reformats. Postcontrast axial CTA chest with coronal and sagittal reformats. Post contrast axial CT abdomen and pelvis with intravenous contrast. Coronal and sagittal reformats. One of the following dose optimization techniques was utilized in the performance of this exam: automated exposure control; adjustment of the mA and/or kV according to patient size; or use of iterative reconstruction technique. Specific details can be referenced in the facility's radiology CT exam operational policy. CONTRAST: 110 mL of IV Isovue-370. NONCONTRAST CT BRAIN FINDINGS: CSF SPACES: Ventricles, cisterns, and sulci are diffusely prominent consistent with volume loss which appears age-appropriate. No hydrocephalus, extra-axial hemorrhage, or mass. No midline shift. CEREBRUM: Patchy low-density in the cerebral white matter, commonly associated with chronic small vessel ischemic disease. No clear evidence of acute infarct by CT. No acute intracranial hemorrhage or cerebral edema. CEREBELLUM: No edema, hemorrhage, mass, acute infarction, or significant atrophy. BRAINSTEM: No edema, hemorrhage, mass, acute infarction, or significant atrophy. CALVARIUM: No acute calvarial fracture. The mastoid air cells are normally pneumatized. SINUSES: There is mild mucosal thickening in the left frontal sinus caudally, and moderate mucosal thickening causing partial opacification of the left ethmoid air cells. Mild right ethmoid sinus mucosal thickening. Moderate bilateral maxillary sinus mucosal thickening left greater than right. Probable maxillary antrostomies bilaterally. Nasogastric tube a completely imaged. ORBITS: Limited views are unremarkable. OTHER: Negative. CTA CHEST FINDINGS: CARDIAC: Heart was scanned during partial systole which makes RV LV ratio assessment somewhat difficult but the RV LV ratio is probably elevated about 1.0. There are mild coronary artery calcifications. Overall normal heart size with no pericardial effusion in the prominent epicardial fat. MEDIASTINUM/HILA: Enlarged with ill-defined subcarinal nodes, measuring up to about 17 mm short axis on the right series 5 image 171. Questionable esophageal wall thickening, limited assessment due to the nasogastric tube. VASCULATURE: Normal size right-sided aortic arch, with moderate aortic and great vessel calcifications. 3 cm pulmonary embolus within the distal left main pulmonary artery extending into lobar and segmental branches of left upper lobe. There is a branching pulmonary embolism in the lobar and segmental branches of the right lower lobe (5/163). Moderate-sized lobar or solid segmental level embolus left lower lobe (image 166). Endotracheal tube terminates 4.3 cm proximal to the carina. Small air emboli in the right external jugular and left internal jugular veins. At these size these are probably clinically insignificant. CHEST WALL: Unremarkable. No mass or axillary adenopathy. LUNGS/PLEURA: Trace pleural effusions, right larger than left, with mild nearby compression atelectasis. Widespread granulomatous calcifications in both lungs, consistent with sequela of old healed infection. Upon this background a few solid nodules are noted, largest about 6 x 13 mm in the right upper lobe on series 5 image 122. No consolidation. Diffuse bronchial wall thickening. Slightly asymmetric right greater than left irregular subpleural nodularity in the upper lobes, probably pleural parenchymal scarring. BONES: Moderate lower cervical spine and there are degenerative changes. Bridging ossifications and degenerative spurring in the thoracic spine. OTHER: Negative. CT ABDOMEN AND PELVIS FINDINGS: LIVER: Negative. BILIARY: There are cholecystectomy clips in the gallbladder fossa. No intrahepatic bile duct dilatation. There is a 5 mm calcified stone in the distal left common duct just above the ampulla, with mild common duct dilatation to about 12 mm. SPLEEN: Negative. PANCREAS: Age-appropriate pancreatic parenchymal atrophy. No evidence of acute pancreatitis. ADRENALS: Negative. KIDNEYS: Symmetric enhancement with no hydronephrosis or evidence of pyelonephritis. No appreciable stones by contrast-enhanced CT. GI/MESENTERY: Nasogastric tube terminates in the gastric body. There is descending and sigmoid colon diverticulosis. There is diffuse wall prominence of the under distended colon, without nearby fat stranding or fluid, probably artifact due to underdistention rather than mild acute colitis. Elsewhere no bowel wall thickening and no evidence for obstruction. No localized fat stranding or fluid collection. VASCULAR: Moderate vascular calcifications. Borderline size of the distal abdominal aorta, measuring up to 2.8 x 3.0 cm just proximal to the bifurcation. LYMPH NODES: Negative. BLADDER: Bladder wall trabeculation. Foley catheter with related air. PELVIC ORGANS: Enlarged prostate with prominent elevation of the bladder base. BONES: Degenerative changes in the lumbar spine with a few bridging ossifications. Mild hip osteoarthritis. No acute fractures. OTHER: Negative. IMPRESSION: IMPRESSION: 1. Moderate burden of acute pulmonary emboli in the left main pulmonary artery extending into lobar and segmental branches of the left upper lobe, right lower lobe and left lower lobe. There is mild elevation of the RV LV ratio which could indicate right heart strain. 2. Trace pleural effusions, right larger than left with mild nearby compression atelectasis. 3. Widespread granulomatous calcifications in both lungs, consistent with sequela of old healed infection. There are a few noncalcified pulmonary nodules which are indeterminate, largest is 9.5 mm average diameter. 3-6 month follow-up is recommended initially, please see below. 4. Enlarged subcarinal lymph nodes, nonspecific. 5. 5 mm calcified stone in the distal left common duct just above the ampulla with mild common duct dilatation to about 12 mm. No intrahepatic bile duct dilatation. 6. Diffuse wall prominence of the colon which is probably artifact due to underdistention rather than mild acute colitis. 7. Enlarged prostate with bladder wall trabeculation consistent with chronic bladder outlet obstruction. 8. Borderline size of the distal abdominal aorta measuring up to 3.0 cm. 9. Right-sided aortic arch. 10. Small air emboli in the right external jugular and left internal jugular veins. At these size these are probably clinically insignificant. ---------- FLEISCHNER SOCIETY FOLLOW-UP GUIDELINES FOR NEWLY DETECTED INCIDENTAL NODULES IN PERSONS 35 YEARS OF AGE OR OLDER. *These recommendations do NOT apply to lung cancer screening, patients with immunosuppression or patients with a known primary malignancy.

            "answer": "CTA CHEST FOR PE HISTORY: Pulmonary embolism (PE) suspected, high prob TECHNIQUE: Pulmonary embolus protocol - Thin-slice axial imaging of the chest was performed during maximal pulmonary arterial opacification with intravenous nonionic iodinated contrast. 3D coronal slab MIPs and 2D reconstructions in the coronal and sagittal planes were performed to aid in pulmonary embolus detection. Representative images have been stored on PACS. One of the following dose optimization techniques was utilized in the performance of this exam: Automated exposure control; adjustment of the mA and/or kV according to the patient's size; or use of an iterative reconstruction technique. Specific details can be referenced in the facility's radiology CT exam operational policy. CONTRAST: 80 mL of IV Isovue-370. COMPARISON: Chest radiograph 12/31/2023, CT chest 9/30/2020 FINDINGS: CTA CHEST: Please note that this exam is optimized for assessment of the pulmonary arteries and is not intended as a diagnostic study of the thoracic aorta, coronary arteries or venous structures. Angiographic Findings: Pulmonary arteries: Images are degraded by respiratory motion artifact. There are no filling defects in the main, right, left, lobar or visualized proximal segmental branches of the pulmonary arterial system. The more distal pulmonary artery branches are not well evaluated due to motion. There is slightly heterogeneous appearance of some smaller branches in the lingula near the left heart border which could be related to cardiac and respiratory motion. Other vasculature: Mild atherosclerotic calcification along the aortic arch without aneurysm. Additional non-angiographic findings: Lower neck: Negative. Lungs / Pleura: Subpleural pulmonary nodule in the posterior left lower lobe is stable in size at 1.1 cm since the CT chest from 9/30/2020. Hazy groundglass opacification in the posterior lower lungs probably represents atelectasis. No pleural effusion or pneumothorax. Mediastinum / Hila: Negative. Heart / Pericardium: Mitral valve prostheses redemonstrated. Stable heart size. Multivessel coronary artery calcifications. No pericardial effusion. Musculoskeletal / Body wall: Chronic deformities along multiple ribs bilaterally. Bilateral glenohumeral joint degenerative changes partially visualized. Anterior wedging of the T11 vertebral body as seen on the recent CT lumbar spine. Upper abdomen: Negative. IMPRESSION: IMPRESSION: 1. No evidence of pulmonary embolism within the confines of motion. No acute CT findings in the chest. 2. Stable 1.1 cm left lower lobe subpleural pulmonary nodule since 9/30/2020. Report E-Signed By: Bryce Meyer at 1/2/2024 4:38 PM WSN:AMICRAD84",

            "answer": "CTA CHEST FOR PE DATE OF EXAM: 01/09/2024, 1038 INDICATION: Pulmonary embolism (PE) suspected, high prob, chest pain, recent hospitalization, pneumonia. Eval PE, pna, effusion TECHNIQUE: Using multidetector CT, contrast enhanced chest CT was performed. Three-dimensional (MIP) reconstructions were performed. Three-dimensional coronal and sagittal MIP reconstructions were performed. All CT scans at this facility use dose modulation, iterative reconstruction, and/or weight based dosing when appropriate to reduce radiation dose to as low as reasonably achievable. CONTRAST: Isovue 370 75 mL COMPARISON: Chest radiography dated 1/9/24 FINDINGS: CTA: Contrast bolus timing allows for adequate evaluation to the level of the lobar pulmonary arteries on the left in the segmental arteries on the right. No filling defect to suggest pulmonary embolus. There is mixing artifact at the sagittal, left main pulmonary artery, and left lobar arteries. There is poor opacification of the left segmental pulmonary artery branches. There is trace mixing artifact at the subsegmental branches of the right lower lobe. Enlarged caliber of the main pulmonary trunk. Thyroid: Visualized portions are unremarkable. Thoracic inlet: No supraclavicular adenopathy. Mediastinum and hila: No mediastinal or hilar adenopathy. Thoracic esophagus is unremarkable. Heart and great vessels: Dilated cardiac chambers. Marked dilation of the right atrium. Contrast from the bolus refluxes into the hepatic veins, a finding that can be seen in the setting of right heart dysfunction. Coronary artery calcifications. No pericardial effusion. The ascending aorta spanning 3.9 cm. Upper limits normal Lungs, airway and pleura: Central airways are patent and normal in caliber. Patchy consolidation groundglass opacities at the right middle lobe, and right lower lobe. There is dense consolidation at both dependent lower lobes which may represent atelectasis. Small to moderate bilateral pleural effusions. No pneumothorax. Breast and axilla: Symmetric appearing breast tissue bilaterally. No axillary adenopathy. Upper Abdomen: There is a retroperitoneal mass interposed between the left adrenal gland and the left kidney. It is heterogeneous density with macroscopic fatty components. It measures up to 5.3 cm on series/image 5/282. Bones/Soft tissues: Multilevel degenerative change of the visualized spine. No aggressive osseous lesion. IMPRESSION: IMPRESSION: 1. No evidence of central pulmonary embolism on a suboptimal study due to contrast mixing artifact. 2. Findings suggestive of right heart dysfunction: Enlarged caliber of the main pulmonary trunk; reflux of contrast into the hepatic veins; dilated right atrium. Consider correlation for strain with echocardiography. 3. Patchy groundglass opacities and consolidation at the right middle and lower lobes in keeping with multifocal infectious/inflammatory process (for example Covid 19 pneumonia). 4. Small to moderate bilateral pleural effusions and adjacent lower lobes atelectasis. 5. Borderline enlarged ascending aorta, spanning 3.9 cm. 6. Retroperitoneal mass measuring 5.3 cm, which may be arising from the left adrenal gland or the left kidney upper pole.

Imaging during the pulmonary arterial phase. 3-D MIP vascular multiplanar reconstructions were performed. All CT scans at this facility use dose modulation, iterative reconstruction, and/or weight based dosing when appropriate to reduce radiation dose to as low as reasonably achievable. COMPARISON: Radiograph 11/10/2023, CT 8/29/2023, 2/7/2021. FINDINGS: Pulmonary arteries: Multiple segmental and subsegmental pulmonary emboli are noted, most notably in the lingula and left lower lobe. Main pulmonary artery enlargement may be seen in the setting of pulmonary arterial hypertension. Heart: No pericardial effusion. Coronary artery disease. Systemic vasculature: Minimal vascular calcifications. Lymph nodes: Negative for bulky lymphadenopathy. Subcentimeter mediastinal lymph nodes retain fatty hila. Lungs: 18 mm posterior right basilar lesion appears similar in size compared with prior 8/29/2023. Mosaic pattern attenuation and bronchial wall thickening suggestive of small airways disease. Sequela of prior granulomatous disease. Trachea and central airways: Patent. Bronchial wall thickening. Pleura: No pneumothorax. No pleural effusion. Bones: Multilevel spinal degenerative change.. Soft tissues: No acute abnormality. Abdomen: Fatty atrophy of the pancreas. Nonspecific bilateral perinephric stranding is partially visualized. IMPRESSION: IMPRESSION: 1. Positive for pulmonary emboli, most notably multiple segmental and subsegmental lingular and right lower lobe pulmonary emboli. Negative for CT evidence of right heart strain. 2. Mosaic pattern attenuation and bronchial wall thickening suggestive of small airways disease. 3. 18 mm posterior right basilar lesion in a region of atelectasis appears similar in size compared with prior 8/29/2023, but increased from prior from 2021. While this may represent atelectasis, underlying malignancy is not entirely excluded and continued surveillance is recommended. 4. Pulmonary arterial enlargement may be seen in the setting of pulmonary arterial hypertension. Findings discussed via phone with Dr. Heaton at 1:37 PM, 1/2/2024. .

Sagittal, coronal and slab 3D MIP coronal reconstructed images were also created for further evaluation and interpretation. CONTRAST: Isovue-370 65 mls. One of the following dose optimization techniques was utilized in the performance of this exam: Automated exposure control; adjustment of the mA and/or kV according to the patient's size; or use of an iterative reconstruction technique. Specific details can be referenced in the facility's radiology CT exam operational policy. COMPARISON: Chest x-ray January 2, 2024. FINDINGS: Neck: There is no supraclavicular lymphadenopathy. Heart/coronary vessels: There has been sternotomy for CABG. Sternal wires are noted. There is inflammatory change throughout the mediastinum related to prior surgery. Inferiorly there are external pacing wires. The RV: LV ratio is approximately 0.9. Prosthetic aortic valve. Postoperative changes tricuspid valve. Pulmonary arteries: There is a filling defect in the posterior segmental right upper lobe artery. There is also a more distal filling defect in the apical segmental pulmonary artery of the right upper lobe. There is underfilling of the medial basal segmental arteries bilaterally and these areas are not evaluated. This could be related to technique and/or atelectasis. Thoracic aorta: Unremarkable without findings of dissection. Coronary bypass grafts noted from the ascending aorta. Mediastinum: Negative. Lymph nodes: Negative. Lungs/pleura: Lung volumes are low due to bibasilar postoperative atelectasis and small bilateral pleural effusions; left side greater than right. Visualized upper abdomen: Negative. Bones/soft tissues: Status post sternotomy for CABG. IMPRESSION: IMPRESSION: 1. There are filling defects in the right upper lobe segmental pulmonary arteries as described above. The findings are consistent with low volume pulmonary embolus. 2. Bibasilar atelectasis with small bilateral pleural effusions; left side greater than right.

Imaging during the pulmonary arterial phase. 3-D MIP vascular multiplanar reconstructions were performed. All CT scans at this facility use dose modulation, iterative reconstruction, and/or weight based dosing when appropriate to reduce radiation dose to as low as reasonably achievable. COMPARISON: 10/31/2023 FINDINGS: Pulmonary arteries: Multiple bilateral pulmonary emboli, the largest of which is in the distal right main pulmonary artery, with multiple right lobar, segmental, and subsegmental pulmonary emboli. Segmental pulmonary emboli most notably in the left lower lobe. . Heart: No pericardial effusion. Coronary artery disease. Reflux of contrast into the IVC. Systemic vasculature: Aortic and branch vessel atherosclerotic change. Lymph nodes: 8 mm high right paratracheal lymph node is nonspecific. 1.0 cm subcarinal lymph node. Additional subcentimeter mediastinal lymph nodes. Other mediastinum: Diffuse esophageal wall thickening may be secondary to reflux/esophagitis. Lungs: Groundglass nodular opacities in the right lower lobe and to a lesser extent the left lower lobe. Trachea and central airways: Secretions within the trachea. Bronchial wall thickening. Opacification of multiple distal airways predominantly in the right lower lobe may be secondary to infectious/inflammatory etiology/mucous plugging. Pleura: No pneumothorax. No pleural effusion. Bones: Multilevel spinal degenerative change. Soft tissues: No acute abnormality Abdomen: Fatty atrophy of the pancreas. Aortic and branch vessel atherosclerotic change. IMPRESSION: IMPRESSION: 1. Multiple bilateral pulmonary emboli, most notably in the distal right main pulmonary artery and lobar branches. Bilateral segmental pulmonary emboli. There is flattening of the interventricular septum and mild reflux of contrast into the IVC. Findings may be secondary to right heart strain; consider echocardiogram. 2. Groundglass nodular opacities in the right lower lobe and to a lesser extent the left lower lobe. Findings may be infectious/inflammatory. 3. Diffuse esophageal wall thickening may be secondary to reflux/esophagitis. Findings discussed with Rowan Keating, PA via phone at 5:15 PM, 1/2/2024 .

Imaging during the pulmonary arterial phase. 3-D MIP vascular multiplanar reconstructions were performed. All CT scans at this facility use dose modulation, iterative reconstruction, and/or weight based dosing when appropriate to reduce radiation dose to as low as reasonably achievable. COMPARISON: 12/6/2023 FINDINGS: Pulmonary arteries: No large central or large lobar filling defects detected. Main pulmonary artery enlargement may be seen in the setting of pulmonary arterial hypertension. Heart: No pericardial effusion. Cardiomegaly with left ventricular hypertrophy. Systemic vasculature: Ascending aorta measures up to 3.9 cm in diameter, though limited due to non-gated study and pulsation artifact. Lymph nodes: Enlarged mediastinal lymph nodes appear decreased in size compared with prior. Mildly enlarged axillary lymph nodes. Lungs: Diffuse centrilobular nodularity and groundglass opacities bilaterally. Subtle increased interstitial markings Subtle infiltrative appearing opacity in the right lower lobe. Multifocal subsegmental atelectasis. Punctate peripheral lingular nodule also present on prior. Trachea and central airways: Patent. Mild distal bronchial wall thickening. Pleura: No pneumothorax. No pleural effusion. Bones: No acute abnormality. Diffusely heterogeneous marrow likely secondary to sickle cell disease.. Soft tissues: Tunneled dialysis catheter distal tip in the right atrium. Right chest wall port tip near the superior cavoatrial junction. Abdomen: Hepatomegaly. Small ascites. The kidneys appear atrophic bilaterally. Increased density of the liver may be related to prior transfusions. IMPRESSION: IMPRESSION: 1. No evidence of large central or large lobar pulmonary embolism. Limited evaluation for segmental or subsegmental pulmonary embolism. 2. Subtle infiltrative opacities in the right lower lobe. Findings may be secondary to acute chest syndrome given history of sickle cell disease or infection. 3. Diffuse centrilobular nodularity and groundglass groundglass opacities. Findings may be secondary to atypical infection. Partially visualized ascites. Subtle increased interstitial opacities in the bases bilaterally. Superimposed pulmonary edema is also a consideration. 4. Ascending aorta measures up to 3.9 cm in diameter, though limited due to non-gated study and pulsation artifact. 5. Interval decrease in mediastinal lymphadenopathy. 6. Main pulmonary artery enlargement may be seen in the setting of pulmonary arterial hypertension. .

Report E-Signed By: Joseph Carabetta at 1/5/2024 11:49 AM WSN:AMICRAD25 CTA CHEST FOR PE, CT ABDOMEN/PELVIS WITH CONTRAST COMPARISON: None. HISTORY: Pulmonary embolism (PE) suspected, high prob. TECHNIQUE: Axial CT angiography of the chest with intravenous contrast. Axial CT of the abdomen and pelvis postcontrast. Coronal and sagittal reformats. Coronal MIP reconstructions were also created for further evaluation and interpretation. One of the following dose optimization techniques was utilized in the performance of this exam: automated exposure control; adjustment of the mA and/or kV according to patient size; or use of iterative reconstruction technique. Specific details can be referenced in the facility's radiology CT exam operational policy. CONTRAST: 100 mL of IV Isovue-370. CT CHEST FINDINGS: CARDIAC: Moderate cardiomegaly with right heart enlargement and straightening of the interventricular septum and an elevated RV LV ratio 0.95 suggestive of right heart strain. MEDIASTINUM/HILA: Unremarkable. No mass or significantly enlarged lymph nodes. VASCULATURE: Mild atherosclerotic calcifications. Enlarged main pulmonary artery, 3.9 cm transverse, suggesting pulmonary artery hypertension. Multiple acute pulmonary emboli are noted bilaterally. This includes moderate size pulmonary emboli within multiple lobar and signal branches of the right lower lobe, smaller segmental emboli in the right upper lobe, small moderate-sized lobar and segmental branch emboli in the left upper and left lower lobes. CHEST WALL: Unremarkable. No mass or axillary adenopathy. LUNGS/PLEURA: Small right and trace left pleural effusions, both layering dependently. There is subsegmental atelectasis in both lower lobes. There are parenchymal opacities consistent with pulmonary infarcts in the lingula measuring 4.3 cm on series 6 image 214 and the right lower lobe measuring about 2.5 cm image 251. Mild respiratory motion artifact bilaterally. BONES: Moderate degenerative changes in the visualized spine. Vertebral hemangioma in T5. CT abdomen and pelvis findings: There is mild motion artifact in the abdomen. LIVER: Negative. BILIARY: The gallbladder is unremarkable by CT and there is no bile duct dilatation. SPLEEN: Negative. PANCREAS: Negative. ADRENALS: Negative. KIDNEYS: Symmetric parenchymal enhancement. No hydronephrosis or pyelonephritis. There is a 7 cm mildly complex cyst in the upper pole right kidney (series 2 image 48), which is a thin peripherally calcified septation within it on coronal series 4 image 67 (Bosniak 2 benign lesion). Mildly complex cyst in the mid right kidney measuring 7.1 cm on series 2 image 65 with a thin peripheral partially calcified septation on series 2 image 68 (Bosniak 2/benign). Intermediate density probable proteinaceous cyst in the mid left kidney posteriorly measuring 4.7 cm image 46, measuring 38 Hounsfield units in density. GI/MESENTERY: There is no bowel wall thickening, mass or evidence for obstruction. No localized fat stranding, free air or fluid collection. VASCULAR: Moderate vascular calcifications. Normal size abdominal aorta. No fusiform morphologies but both common iliac arteries are larger than typical at 1.8 cm diameter, consistent with common iliac artery aneurysms. LYMPH NODES: Negative. BLADDER: 4.3 cm right posterolateral bladder diverticulum. PELVIC ORGANS: Enlarged prostate elevating the bladder base in the midline. Bilateral vasectomy clips. BONES: Advanced lumbar spine degenerative changes. Mild hip osteoarthritis. No concerning for bone or soft tissue lesions. OTHER: Negative. IMPRESSION: IMPRESSION: 1. Multiple acute pulmonary emboli bilaterally with findings suggesting right heart strain. 2. Pulmonary infarcts in the lingula and right lower lobe. 3. Small right and trace left pleural effusions. 4. No acute bowel pathology or cause for abdominal pain. 5. Benign Bosniak 2 renal cysts bilaterally do not require follow-up. There is an intermediate density technically indeterminate 4.7 cm lesion in the left kidney, favored to represent a benign cyst proteinaceous cyst, but differentiation from a solid lesion is not possible without pre and postcontrast technique. Targeted renal ultrasound follow-up recommended. 6. 4.3 cm right posterolateral bladder diverticulum. 7. Enlarged prostate. 8. 1.8 cm common iliac artery aneurysms bilaterally.

Lower neck: A right chest port is in place which terminates in the superior vena cava. No supraclavicular adenopathy. Heart/vessels: Heart is normal in size. Dense trivessel coronary artery disease is present. The pulmonary arteries are are opacified adequately to the proximal segmental level. There is no evidence of central pulmonary embolism. Dense aortic atheromatous calcifications. Mediastinum: Limited evaluation of the lymph nodes due to phase of contrast. A subcarinal lymph node remains enlarged measuring 2.6 x 1.9 cm on series 5 image 36. Lungs/pleura: Since prior evaluation, there is new groundglass opacification of nearly the entire right lung as well as the aerated portions of the left lower lobe. Chronic consolidation with traction bronchiectasis and fibrosis in the left upper lobe and left upper lower lobe with associated volume loss are similar. The previously identified small pulmonary nodules on the right side are not not well characterized today due to extensive groundglass abnormality. Trace left pleural effusion. Visualized upper abdomen: Liver is partially obscured by beam hardening artifact. Nonspecific perinephric stranding. Spleen is unremarkable. No pneumoperitoneum. Bones/soft tissues: Severe scoliotic deformity with vertebroplasty cement at T12. Stable inferior endplate compression of L1. No definite new osseous abnormality. Sclerotic focus in the left eighth rib is stable. IMPRESSION: IMPRESSION: 1. No evidence of pulmonary embolism 2. Extensive new groundglass and consolidative opacities throughout the right lung are favored to be infectious or inflammatory.

One of the following dose optimization techniques was utilized in the performance of this exam: Automated exposure control; adjustment of the mA and/or kV according to the patient's size; or use of an iterative reconstruction technique. Specific details can be referenced in the facility's radiology CT exam operational policy. CONTRAST: Isovue-370, 80 mL COMPARISON: None. FINDINGS: Lower chest: Left-sided pacemaker/defibrillator is in place. Extensive beam Harding artifact from the pacemaker obscures lower neck evaluation and upper chest evaluation. Thyroid is unremarkable. Heart/vessels: Heart is globally enlarged. There is reflux of contrast into the hepatic venous system consistent with congestive heart failure. Main pulmonary artery is enlarged measuring up to 3.9 cm. Evaluation for pulmonary embolism is adequate to the proximal segmental level. There is no evidence of central pulmonary embolism. Mediastinum: Scattered calcified mediastinal and hilar lymph nodes. The esophagus is unremarkable. Lymph nodes: Negative. Lungs/pleura: Extensive patchy bilateral pulmonary opacities, worst in the right upper lobe. These are associated with a trace left pleural effusion. Extensive pulmonary opacities limit evaluation for underlying pulmonary nodules. There is groundglass opacification primarily affecting the lingula and right lower lobe. There are areas of relative sparing of the lung, for instance, in the superior left upper lobe. Visualized upper abdomen: Negative. Bones/soft tissues: Densely sclerotic focus in the right anterior eighth rib on series 5 image 100 is likely a bone island. Otherwise, no suspicious osseous lesion. No evidence of fracture. IMPRESSION: IMPRESSION: 1. No evidence of pulmonary embolism to the proximal segmental level. 2. Extensive patchy bilateral pulmonary opacities, worst in the right upper lobe. These are associated with a trace left pleural effusion. Findings are most consistent with multifocal pneumonia. 3. Cardiomegaly with reflux of contrast into the hepatic venous system consistent with congestive heart failure. 4. Enlarged main pulmonary artery, which can be seen in the setting of pulmonary arterial hypertension. Report E-Signed By: Kristofer Schramm at 1/8/2024 11:01 AM WSN:AMICRAD83",

Report E-Signed By: Joseph Carabetta at 1/12/2024 7:41 AM WSN:M-RAD020 CTA CHEST FOR PE COMPARISON: CT abdomen earlier in the day, CTA chest 11/20/2021 HISTORY: Pulmonary embolism (PE) suspected, high prob, PE seen on CT a/p, further evaluation of PE. TECHNIQUE: Axial CT angiography of the chest with intravenous contrast. Coronal and sagittal reformats. Coronal MIP reconstructions were also created for further evaluation and interpretation. One of the following dose optimization techniques was utilized in the performance of this exam: automated exposure control; adjustment of the mA and/or kV according to patient size; or use of iterative reconstruction technique. Specific details can be referenced in the facility's radiology CT exam operational policy. CONTRAST: 100 mL of IV Isovue-370. CT CHEST FINDINGS: CARDIAC: Limited RV LV ratio of 1.34. Diffuse left ventricular wall prominence with relative sparing of the apex, artifact due to scanning during cardiac systole favored over left ventricular hypertrophy. No pericardial effusion. MEDIASTINUM/HILA: Enlarged AP window lymph node, 1.5 x 2.9 cm six image 90, previously 1.2 x 2.5 cm. Moderately enlarged right hilar node, 2.0 x 2.8 cm on image 120, previously 1.4 x 1.8 cm. A mildly enlarged subcarinal node is also noted, new from previous. VASCULATURE: Mild atherosclerotic calcifications. Multiple pulmonary artery filling defects consistent with acute pulmonary emboli. This includes segmental and subsegmental branches of the right upper lobe, including posterior segment right upper lobe embolus with associated pulmonary infarct, segmental and subsegmental branches of the right middle lobe, segmental and subsegmental branches of the right lower lobe, a small embolism in the distal left main pulmonary artery extending into a lobar artery branch of the left lower lobe. CHEST WALL: No mass or adenopathy. Right breast skin thickening was noted on recent CT chest. The breasts are cropped from the field-of-view on this study. LUNGS/PLEURA: Moderate centrilobular emphysema. Next consolidation/groundglass density pulmonary infarct in the right upper lobe posterior segment and the distribution of pulmonary emboli. 3 x 5 mm right middle lobe pulmonary nodule on series 6 image 160 is stable from 2021, for differential inflation. Multiple new upper lobe predominant pulmonary nodules, measuring up to about 2 x 5 mm in the right upper lobe series 6 image 64. BONES: Moderate thoracic spine degenerative changes. No concerning bone lesions. LIMITED ABDOMEN: Granulomatous calcification in the spleen. A completely imaged left renal cyst. Vascular calcifications. Dilated bile ducts due to choledocholithiasis noted on today's abdominal CT. OTHER: Negative. IMPRESSION: IMPRESSION: 1. Multiple acute pulmonary emboli bilaterally with associated pulmonary infarct in the right upper lobe posterior segment. 2. Elevated RV LV ratio suggesting right heart strain. 3. Multiple new upper lobe predominant pulmonary nodules measuring up to about 2 x 5 mm in size, probably infectious/inflammatory. Three month follow-up recommended given the multiplicity and moderate background emphysema, as metastatic disease cannot be excluded. 4. Enlarging mediastinal and right hilar lymph nodes, and these could be reactive or metastatic. 5. Dilated bile ducts due to choledocholithiasis noted on today's abdominal CT. 6. Right breast skin thickening was noted on recent CT chest. The breasts are cropped from the field-of-view on this study. Report E-Signed By: Joseph Carabetta at 1/12/2024 7:32 AM WSN:M-RAD020",

Post-processing was performed with creation of maximum intensity projection images (MIP). All CT scans at this facility use dose modulation, interactive reconstruction, and/or weight based dosing when appropriate to reduce radiation dose to as low as reasonably achievable. CLINICAL HISTORY: Pulmonary embolism (PE) suspected, unknown D-dimer COMPARISON: CT 10/17/2023 FINDINGS: Study Quality: Degraded by quantum mottle artifact such that subsegmental pulmonary emboli could be missed. Pulmonary arteries: No segmental or larger pulmonary embolus. Dilated main pulmonary artery measuring up to 3.5 cm. Thoracic inlet: No adenopathy. Axillae and thoracic wall: No adenopathy. Mediastinum: No pathologic adenopathy. Slight shifting of the mediastinal structures to the left. Aorta: Non-dilated. Heart: Severe coronary artery calcifications. Central airways, lung parenchyma, and pleura: Trace right pleural effusion. Large right pneumothorax. Peripheral reticulations which are most pronounced at the lung bases. Consolidations at the lung bases. Upper abdomen: Process peripherally calcified lesion in the left upper quadrant is again noted and likely represents a splenule versus splenosis. 5.6 cm cyst arising from the superior pole of the left kidney. Of the Musculoskeletal structures: Moderate degenerative change of the spine without acute or aggressive lesion. IMPRESSION: IMPRESSION: 1. Degraded by quantum mottle artifact such that subsegmental pulmonary emboli could be missed. Within this limitation, no segmental or larger pulmonary embolus. 2. Large right pneumothorax with slight shifting of the mediastinal structures to the left. 3. Trace right pleural effusion. 4. Redemonstrated fibrotic lung changes. Consolidations at the lung bases could represent atelectasis or pneumonia. 5. Dilated main pulmonary artery, as can be seen in the setting of pulmonary hypertension. Urgent findings were communicated to KYLE BARNETT, PAC by Matthew Goodstein, DO on 1/14/2024 1:44 AM via Epic secure messaging system with confirmation of receipt by provider.

Report E-Signed By: Alison Sheridan Nath at 1/15/2024 10:18 AM WSN:AMICRAD60 CTA CHEST FOR PE HISTORY: elevated d-dimer, complaints of new hemoptysis, recent travel TECHNIQUE: CTA chest with intravenous contrast attention to pulmonary arteries. Sagittal, coronal and slab 3D MIP coronal reconstructed images were also created for further evaluation and interpretation. One of the following dose optimization techniques was utilized in the performance of this exam: Automated exposure control; adjustment of the mA and/or kV according to the patient's size; or use of an iterative reconstruction technique. Specific details can be referenced in the facility's radiology CT exam operational policy. CONTRAST: 75 mL Isovue 370 COMPARISON: CT 1/8/2024 FINDINGS: Devices: None. Thoracic inlet: No supraclavicular adenopathy. Mediastinum and hila: No mediastinal or hilar adenopathy. Heart and great vessels: There is a single subsegmental pulmonary artery branch in the left posterior lower lobe which does not opacify with contrast which is associated with a peripheral wedge-shaped consolidative opacity (image 124, series 6). No pericardial effusion. Severe coronary artery calcifications. The main pulmonary artery is normal in caliber. The ascending thoracic aorta is normal in caliber. Lungs, airway and pleura: Moderate centrilobular and paraseptal emphysema. There is a wedge-shaped area of consolidation in the left posterior lower lobe (image 104, series 6). There is a trace left pleural effusion. Moderate bronchial wall thickening bilaterally. There are a few clustered right upper lobe nodules measuring up to 4 mm (image 192, series 6). Axilla: Negative. Upper abdomen: Negative. Bones and Soft Tissue: Negative. IMPRESSION: IMPRESSION: Single subsegmental pulmonary artery branch in the left posterior lower lobe which does not opacify with contrast which is associated with a peripheral wedge-shaped consolidative opacity. This is suspicious for a subsegmental pulmonary artery embolism with associated pulmonary infarct. Differential diagnosis of infectious consolidation versus atelectasis. Recommend further evaluation with lower extremity ultrasound to evaluate for DVT. Moderate centrilobular and paraseptal emphysema. Clustered right upper lobe nodules measuring up to 4 mm. These are likely infectious or inflammatory in etiology. Recommend follow-up in one year to document continued stability. Severe coronary artery calcifications.

FINDINGS: Vessels: Contrast bolus timing/quality is satisfactory for evaluation of the pulmonary arteries to the segmental/subsegmental level. Scattered small subsegmental pulmonary emboli seen within the lingula, left lower lobe, and right lower lobe. Associated small pulmonary infarcts with these. No central PE. Reflux of contrast into the hepatic veins. Normal caliber main pulmonary artery. Normal caliber thoracic aorta. Lower neck: Negative. Heart: Cardiomegaly, specifically with the left ventricle appearing enlarged. The right atrium and left atrium also appear enlarged. Normal RV/LV ratio. Mediastinum: Negative. Lymph nodes: Perihilar thickening without frank lymphadenopathy. Lungs/pleura: Moderate layering bilateral pleural effusions. Bilateral interlobular septal thickening in keeping with pulmonary edema. Fairly diffuse bronchial wall thickening bilaterally is also favored secondary to edema. Visualized upper abdomen: Trace ascites. Fairly diffuse mesenteric haziness.

Imaging during the pulmonary arterial phase. 3-D MIP vascular multiplanar reconstructions were performed. 3-D rib reformats archived to PACS. All CT scans at this facility use dose modulation, iterative reconstruction, and/or weight based dosing when appropriate to reduce radiation dose to as low as reasonably achievable. COMPARISON: 1/19/2024 FINDINGS: Pulmonary arteries: No large central or lobar filling defects detected. Mild pulmonary artery enlargement may be seen in the setting of pulmonary arterial hypertension. Limited detection of segmental or subsegmental pulmonary embolism. Heart: No pericardial effusion. The heart is mildly enlarged. Systemic vasculature: Ascending aorta measures approximately 3.7 cm in caliber. Aortic arch measures approximately 3.2 cm in caliber. Lymph nodes: Density in the anterior mediastinum similar to prior and may represent residual/reactive thymic tissue. Lungs: Diffusely increased interstitial markings and increased alveolar opacities most prominent in the right upper lobe in the bases bilaterally. Trachea and central airways: Endotracheal tube tip positioning similar to prior. Pleura: No pneumothorax. Trace left and small right pleural fluid with adjacent atelectasis. Bones: No acute abnormality. Soft tissues: No acute abnormality. Abdomen: Esophagogastric catheter courses below the diaphragm into the stomach. IMPRESSION: IMPRESSION: 1. No evidence of large central or lobar pulmonary embolism. 2. Cardiomegaly. Increased interstitial markings and groundglass opacities concerning for edema. Superimposed multifocal infiltrative appearing opacities may represent superimposed infection. Trace left and small right pleural fluid. 3. Nonspecific hazy anterior mediastinal densities may represent residual/reactive thymic tissue, but are incompletely characterized and neoplastic process is not definitively excluded. .

TECHNIQUE: Helical CT imaging of the chest was performed with 75 mL of IV Isovue-370. Multiplanar and MIP reconstructions were provided. All CT scans at this location are performed using dose modulation techniques as appropriate to a performed exam including the following: Automated exposure control; adjustment of the mA and/or kV according to patient size (this includes techniques or standardized protocols for targeted exams where dose is matched to indication / reason for exam; i.e., extremities or head); use of iterative reconstruction technique. DOSE: CTDIvol: 12.3 mGy DLP: 382 mGy-cm PROBLEM-SPECIFIC FINDINGS: PULMONARY VASCULATURE: There are small pulmonary emboli in the anterior and lingular subsegmental pulmonary arteries of the left upper lobe, the posterior segmental pulmonary artery of the right upper lobe, the middle segmental pulmonary artery the right middle lobe, and the posterior basilar segmental artery of the right lower lobe. LUNGS: There are small consolidations in the left lung base which may reflect a very small pulmonary infarctions. The chest is otherwise clear. PLEURA: No effusions or pleural plaques. ADDITIONAL FINDINGS: CHEST AIRWAYS: Patent. MEDIASTINUM: There are no pericardial effusions or any mediastinal lymphadenopathy. HILA: Normal. No adenopathy. UPPER ABDOMEN: Within normal limits. BONES: No aggressive lytic or blastic lesions. LOWER NECK: The lower neck soft tissues are normal. SKIN/SOFT TISSUES: The skin and superficial soft tissues are normal. IMPRESSION: IMPRESSION: 1. Small acute pulmonary emboli in the left upper lobe, right upper lobe, right middle lobe, and right lower lobe as detailed above. There are no CT findings of right heart strain. 2. Very small consolidation in the left lung base is nonspecific and may represent subsegmental atelectasis or a very small pulmonary infarction.

Specific details can be referenced in the facility's radiology CT exam operational policy. CONTRAST: 80 mL Isovue-370 COMPARISON: CT PE dated 11/9/2016 and chest radiograph dated 2/5/2022. FINDINGS: Heart/vessels: Since prior exam, there is increased caliber of the ascending thoracic aorta, now measuring 4.9 cm. The descending thoracic aorta now measures 3.7 cm, previously 2.3 cm. The left vertebral artery originates from the aortic arch. The innominate artery measures up to 2.1 cm. There is subtle irregularity along the arterial wall of the left subclavian artery, 6/234 and 901/36. Coronary calcifications are noted. Late timing of contrast and respiratory motion limits evaluation of the pulmonary arteries. To the level of the lobar pulmonary arteries, there is no filling defect. Mediastinum: Negative. Lymph nodes: Mildly prominent precarinal lymph node measuring up to 9 mm. Lungs/pleura: 3 mm nodule in the right lung apex, 6/233, is new 1.1 x 2.0 cm consolidation versus nodularity in the right upper lung, 6/193, was not present previously. Other subpleural nodules scattered throughout the lungs measuring up to 8 mm are new, 6/142.. Visualized upper abdomen: Negative. Bones/soft tissues: New since prior CT, there is superior endplate T1 deformity, T5 compression causing approximately 40% height loss and no significant retropulsion and marked T11 compression causing near vertebral plana anteriorly with approximately 6 mm retropulsion of the superior fragments posteriorly.. IMPRESSION: IMPRESSION: 1. No evidence of pulmonary embolism to the lobar pulmonary arteries. 2. Interval increase in caliber of the ascending thoracic aorta, now measuring 4.9 cm. 3. Interval increase in size of the innominate artery, now measuring 2.1 cm. 4. Irregularity along the arterial wall of the left subclavian artery with associated dilation of the thoracic aorta and innominate artery may suggest underlying vascular etiology such as FMD or vasculitis. Could consider further workup with evaluation of the carotid arteries or renal arteries as well as underlying inflammatory markers. 5. New T1, T5, and T11 compression fractures. 6. New right upper lung consolidation versus nodularity. 7. Multiple new pulmonary nodules measuring up to 8 mm. Non-contrast chest CT at 3-6 months is recommended. If the nodules are stable at time of repeat CT, then future CT at 18-24 months (from today's scan) is considered optional for low-risk patients, but is recommended for high-risk patients (Per Fleischner Society guidelines). 8. Mildly prominent precarinal lymph node is likely reactive. The above results were communicated to Dr Karimov of the primary team by Christopher Doe, MD on 1/22/2024 2:17 PM.

Imaging performed during the pulmonary arterial phase. 3-D MIP vascular multiplanar reconstructions were performed. All CT scans at this facility use dose modulation, iterative reconstruction, and/or weight based dosing when appropriate to reduce radiation dose to as low as reasonably achievable. COMPARISON: None available. FINDINGS: Pulmonary arteries: Multiple pulmonary emboli, most notably in the distal right lower lobar artery and multiple segmental and subsegmental branches. Flattening of the interventricular septum and mild reflux of contrast into the IVC. Main pulmonary artery enlargement may be seen in the setting of pulmonary arterial hypertension.. Heart: No pericardial effusion. Flattening of the interventricular septum. Biatrial enlargement. Systemic vasculature: Limited evaluation grossly unremarkable. Lymph nodes: Negative for bulky lymphadenopathy. Other mediastinum: No acute abnormality. Lungs: Small right lower lobe opacity favored pulmonary infarct rather than infection.

One of the following dose optimization techniques was utilized in the performance of this exam: Automated exposure control; adjustment of the mA and/or kV according to the patient's size; or use of an iterative reconstruction technique. Specific details can be referenced in the facility's radiology CT exam operational policy. CONTRAST: Isovue-370, 70 mL COMPARISON: Multiple priors including PET/CT from 12 a 23 FINDINGS: CHEST WALL: Base of the neck is unremarkable. Thyroid is unremarkable. Mildly prominent bilateral axillary lymph nodes. Status post median sternotomy. Heart/vessels: Status post aortic valve replacement with ascending aortic repair. The ascending aorta at the level of main pulmonary artery measures 3.9 cm, which is borderline enlarged. Main pulmonary artery is adequately opacified for determination of pulmonary embolism to the proximal segmental level. There is no evidence of pulmonary embolism. Mediastinum: Mild esophageal wall thickening. Large sliding-type hiatal hernia. Lymph nodes: There is enlargement of the mediastinal and hilar lymph nodes which is new since prior study from 12 a 23. For instance, a subcarinal conglomerate on series 17 image 25 measures 4.3 x 1.5 cm, minimally enlarged since prior study. Right hilar adenopathy is also new since prior study. Lungs/pleura: Since prior evaluation, there is new multifocal groundglass and consolidative opacities, worst in the bilateral lower lobes. Background of diffuse pulmonary nodularity has also worsened since prior study, for instance, a prominent right middle lobe pulmonary nodule currently measures 3.0 x 2.3 cm, previously 2.7 x 2.3 cm on prior exam. Background of severe emphysema. Most of the other pulmonary nodules appear similar to slightly enlarged in size. Visualized upper abdomen: Liver is unremarkable. Adrenal glands are within normal limits. Likely vascular calcifications at the renal hila. Remainder of the upper abdominal exam is unremarkable. Bones/soft tissues: Similar appearance of a subacute T12 compression fracture with approximately 40% central vertebral body height loss on series 9 image 54. Age-indeterminate superior endplate deformity of T6. Stable chronic compression deformity of L1. IMPRESSION: IMPRESSION: 1. No evidence of pulmonary embolism to the proximal segmental level. 2. New multifocal groundglass and consolidative opacities, worst in the bilateral lower lobes. Findings are most consistent with multifocal pneumonia or pneumonitis given history of immunotherapy.. 3. Background of diffuse pulmonary nodularity has also worsened since prior study. For instance, the dominant right lung nodule appears slightly larger. 4. New mediastinal and hilar adenopathy. This may be reactive or neoplastic. 5. Subacute T12 compression fracture with approximately 40% central vertebral body height loss. Stable chronic compression deformity of L1.

Shortness of breath is worse with lying flat History of CHF with ejection fraction of 20%. COMPARISON: 4/23/2023. TECHNIQUE: Pulmonary embolus protocol: Thin-slice axial imaging of the chest was performed during maximal pulmonary arterial opacification with intravenous nonionic iodinated contrast. Sagittal and coronal reformats and axial, sagittal, and coronal MIP series were performed to aid in pulmonary embolus detection. One of the following dose optimization techniques was utilized in the performance of this exam: Automated exposure control; adjustment of the mA and/or kV according to the patient's size; or use of an iterative reconstruction technique. Specific details can be referenced in the facility's radiology CT exam operational policy. CONTRAST: 50 mL of IV Isovue-370. FINDINGS: PULMONARY ARTERIES: The pulmonary trunk is normal in caliber. Pulmonary arteries are adequately opacified to the subsegmental level. Left lower lobe segmental and subsegmental pulmonary emboli. THORACIC INLET: Density in the lower right internal jugular vein (image 1 series 5) is likely mixing of contrast with thrombus but less likely. AORTA AND ARCH BRANCH VESSELS: No aneurysm. There is mild atherosclerosis of the distal descending thoracic aorta. HEART/PERICARDIUM: The heart is significantly enlarged, stable. There is streak artifact from ICD leads. There is a small pericardial effusion. There is mild coronary artery calcification, greatest of the proximal LAD. The RV/LV ratio is normal. MEDIASTINUM/HILA: Normal mediastinum. No lymphadenopathy. LUNGS/PLEURA: Small left and trace right pleural effusions have increased in size. Right basilar consolidation is in part due to atelectasis, but there may be superimposed pneumonia and/or developing infarct. Mild emphysema. New 2.2 cm groundglass opacity in the medial right upper lobe (image 36 series 11) may be atelectasis or inflammation/infection. No pneumothorax. The airways are normal. UPPER ABDOMEN: Reflux of contrast into the inferior vena cava and hepatic veins, which can be seen with right heart failure. MUSCULOSKELETAL/VERTEBRA/BODY WALL: No acute abnormality. Stable mild spondylosis. A Schmorl node deforms the T12 superior endplate, stable. Stable mild concave deformity of the T1 superior endplate. IMPRESSION: IMPRESSION: 1. Left lower lobe segmental and subsegmental pulmonary emboli. No heart strain. 2. Small left and trace right pleural effusions have increased in size. 3. Right basilar consolidation is in part due to atelectasis but there may be superimposed pneumonia and/or developing infarct. 4. Groundglass opacity in the medial right upper lobe may be atelectasis or inflammation/infection. 5. Stable enlarged cardiac silhouette with stable reflux of contrast into the inferior vena cava and hepatic veins, which can be seen with right heart failure. Finding of pulmonary emboli was discussed by phone with CHRISTOPHER ZIRKER on 1/31/2024 4:46 AM. Report E-Signed By: Becky Benz, MD at 1/31/2024 4:49 AM WSN:M-RAD020",

CONTRAST: 70 mL Isovue 370 COMPARISON: CT dated 12/13/2023 FINDINGS: Vessels: Contrast bolus timing/quality is satisfactory for evaluation of the pulmonary arteries to the segmental/subsegmental level. No pulmonary embolus. Normal caliber main pulmonary artery. Normal caliber thoracic aorta. Lower neck: Streak artifact limits evaluation. Heart: Normal heart size. Mediastinum: Negative. Lymph nodes: Negative. Lungs/pleura: Acute consolidative right middle lobe and right lower lobe pneumonia. This includes an area of hypodense parenchyma within the deep right lung base above the hemidiaphragm, suspicious for development of necrotizing pneumonia. No pulmonary abscess. New trace right pleural effusion. The above consolidations are associated with new right hemidiaphragmatic elevation/right lower lung volume loss. Visualized upper abdomen: Known liver lesions are not diagnostically evaluated on this exam secondary to contrast timing. Significant interval increase in size of pancreatic tail lesion now measuring approximately 3.6 x 3.1 cm, previously 1.7 x 1.4 cm. There is encasement of the splenic artery by this lesion. Probable abutment without definite encasement of the splenic vein, however the splenic vein is not fully included on this exam. Calcified splenic granulomas are benign. Unchanged portacaval lymphadenopathy. Bones/soft tissues: Partially imaged left shoulder arthroplasty, causing streak artifact. No acute or suspicious osseous findings. Severe lower cervical spine degenerative disc disease. IMPRESSION: 1. No pulmonary embolism. 2. Acute consolidative right middle lobe and right lower lobe pneumonia.

Right inguinal hernia containing fat. Multilevel degenerative changes in the spine. Postoperative changes at L2/L3. Hypoplastic ribs are present at T12. For the purposes of this study, L1 is labeled as the superiormost nonrib-bearing vertebral body. IMPRESSION: 1. Segmental left lower lobe pulmonary embolism. No radiographic evidence of right heart strain. Given the inflammatory process in the spine, cannot exclude septic thrombus. 2. Trace pleural effusions. Patchy consolidations in the lung bases, correlate for infection including septic emboli. 3. Thrombus in the left renal vein. 4. Complex fluid collections in the bilateral psoas muscles, right greater than left, consistent with psoas abscesses. Very suspicious for discitis osteomyelitis, possibly originating from the L1/L2 disc space although difficult to localize due to lack of significant bony change. Consider correlation with contrast-enhanced MR lumbar spine. Please note anomalous segmentation of the lumbar vertebral bodies. Careful attention to the numbering system is recommended if any intervention is planned. Critical findings were discussed with Dr. MARC ELLIOTT BREEN at 2/2/2024 11:26 AM.

            "answer": "EXAM: CTA CHEST FOR PE CLINICAL DATA: Pulmonary embolism (PE) suspected, positive D-dimer TECHNICAL DATA: Contrast-enhanced CT pulmonary CT angiogram of the chest was performed with IV contrast. Multiplanar reconstructions were generated. All CT data was transferred to a 3D workstation for multiplanar reformation and 3D reconstruction under concurrent physician supervision. All CT scans at this facility use dose modulation, iterative reconstruction, and/or weight based dosing when appropriate to reduce radiation dose to as low as reasonably achievable. COMPARISON: Radiographs February 6, 2020 FINDINGS: Filling defects are seen within the right lower lobar and a few segmental pulmonary artery branches (series 5 images 141-162). No large central pulmonary embolism. No evidence for heart strain. No thoracic lymphadenopathy. No pleural effusion. No pericardial effusion. There are tree-in-bud opacities within the right middle lobe and lingula. There is associated bronchiectasis within the lingula parenchymal scarring. Bilateral apical subpleural scarring. Bilateral calcified pleural plaques. 3 mm anterior subpleural right lower lobe nodule (series 5 image 85). 4 mm subpleural anterior right lower lobe nodule (series 5 image 65). 3 mm posterior right lower lobe nodule (series 5 image 26) The central airways appear patent. No acute abnormalities in the upper abdomen. No acute bone abnormalities. IMPRESSION: Impression: Right lower lobar and segmental branch pulmonary emboli. No evidence for heart strain. Changes of chronic atypical pneumonia involving the right middle lobe and lingula including tree-in-bud opacities, lingular bronchiectasis and scarring. Bilateral calcified pleural plaques. Small right lung nodules, ranging up to 4 mm. -Recommend follow-up chest CT in 12 months to determine stability. Results discussed with Dr. Kuper 2/6/2024 at approximately 8:02 AM.

HEART/PERICARDIUM: Normal heart size. Coronary atherosclerosis and/or stents. AORTA/GREAT VESSELS: Minimal calcific atherosclerotic vascular disease. No thoracic aortic aneurysm. PULMONARY ARTERIES/PULMONARY ARTERIAL VASCULAR TREE: Dilated main pulmonary artery to 3.7 cm, compatible with pulmonary arterial hypertension. Positive pulmonary emboli. * Large saddle thrombus at the bifurcation of the LEFT main pulmonary artery. * Near-complete occlusive thrombus in the first second and third order artery supplying the LEFT lingula. * Nonocclusive thrombus involving the first second and third order pulmonary artery supplying the LEFT upper lobe. * Near-complete occlusive thrombus involving the first, second, third and fourth order artery supplying the LEFT lower lobe. * Large nonocclusive saddle thrombus at the bifurcation of the RIGHT main pulmonary artery. * Nonocclusive first, second, and third order thrombi are demonstrated in the RUL, RML, and RLL. PE Risk Stratification: RV size in short axis: 5.9 cm LV size in short axis: 3.6 cm RV/LV ratio: Ratio > 0.9. Positive. Bowing of the septum: Yes Reflux of contrast into IVC: No Thrombus in right atrium or right ventricle: No Thrombus in transit across the atrial septum: No Positive high-grade right heart strain. 3-D RECONSTRUCTED IMAGES: MIP images confirm and further demonstrate the findings from the axial source images.

PLEURA/PLEURAL SPACES: Small left pleural effusion. No pneumothorax. TRACHEA/BRONCHI: Normal. LUNGS: * Enlarging nonspecific 5.4 x 2.8 x 4.9 cm (37 mL) wedge-shaped opacity in the superior segment of the left lower lobe with central cavitation. On the previous exam of 2023, this lesion measured 4.2 x 2.2 x 4.8 cm (22 mL). * New 2.8 x 2.0 cm irregular opacities in the periphery of the right upper lobe. * Resolution of previously demonstrated 1.3 cm RLL nodule. * Resolution of nodular densities in the periphery of the right lower lobe. * Resolution of nodular densities in the left upper lobe, medial right upper lobe. * Resolution of nodular densities in the medial right lung base, medial left upper lobe, and lateral right lower lobe. CHEST WALL/SOFT TISSUES: Unremarkable. BREASTS: * There is a new large 4.7 x 3.7 x 5.0 cm density (5-10 HU) in the inner right breast. This may represent a large cyst. However its margins are indistinct, which is concerning for malignancy. Advise diagnostic bilateral mammogram and diagnostic breast ultrasound to exclude breast cancer. * Prior surgery in the outer right breast. UPPER ABDOMEN: Cholecystectomy. BONES: No acute bony change. Stable multilevel thoracic spondylosis, arthrosis and degenerative disc disease. Stable old small thoracic body compression fractures. SCOUT TOPOGRAM: Otherwise normal. IMPRESSION: 1. Positive for pulmonary embolism with large thrombus load. Secondary high-grade right heart strain and pulmonary arterial hypertension. 2. Enlarging cavitary wedge-shaped opacity in the superior segment of the left lower lobe. Diagnostic considerations include recurrent pneumonia (including atypical pneumonia such as fungal pneumonia), pulmonary infarct related to the pulmonary embolism, and malignancy/metastatic disease. 3. New 5 cm density in inner right breast. Advise diagnostic bilateral mammogram and diagnostic ultrasound on a nonemergent basis to exclude breast cancer. 4. Nonspecific small irregular opacities in the periphery of the right upper lobe, probably related to impression #2. 5. Resolution of multiple previously demonstrated nodular densities, probably representing resolution of pneumonia or treated metastasis. Findings discussed by D.

            "answer": "CTA CHEST FOR PE Provided history: Pulmonary embolism (PE) suspected, positive D-dimer Additional pertinent history: none TECHNIQUE: Pulmonary embolus protocol - Thin-slice axial imaging of the chest was performed during maximal pulmonary arterial opacification with intravenous nonionic iodinated contrast. 3D coronal slab MIPs and 2D reconstructions in the coronal and sagittal planes were performed to aid in pulmonary embolus detection. Representative images have been stored on PACS. EKG gating: no Contrast: 64 ml Isovue 370 One of the following dose optimization techniques was utilized in the performance of this exam: Automated exposure control; adjustment of the mA and/or kV according to the patient's size; or use of an iterative reconstruction technique. Specific details can be referenced in the facility's radiology CT exam operational policy. COMPARISON STUDIES: Plain films yesterday. FINDINGS: Angiographic Findings: Pulmonary arteries: There is no embolism to the main, right or left or lobar arteries. Beyond this point, the dependent vessels are very difficult to assess due to extensive breathing motion artifact. Based upon reconstructed sagittal and coronal series, I see no obvious peripheral emboli. Thoracic aorta: negative. Additional non-angiographic findings: Lungs / pleura / hila: There are no segmental or larger areas of consolidation. Indistinct nonconfluent nodular densities noted dependent right lung base and in the mid right upper lobe, likely inflammatory possibly infectious in origin. I think metastatic disease is unlikely given the absence of similar changes on the left. In addition, there is a mildly enlarged right hilar node short diameter 16 mm. No similar finding in the left hilum. Lower neck: negative Mediastinum: Scattered small likely benign reactive lymph nodes. One lymph node in the subcarinal space is borderline prominent short diameter 15 mm. Heart / pericardium: negative Other Vessels: Mild LAD calcification. Body wall: negative Upper abdomen: negative Lymph nodes: See above. No significant additional lymph node findings. Bones: Multiple old Schmorl's nodes in the thoracic spine. No lytic or blastic osseous lesions. IMPRESSION: 1. No evidence of central embolism to the lobar level. Limited assessment of peripheral vessels due to breathing motion artifact but no obvious peripheral emboli. 2. No segmental or larger areas of consolidation. Indistinct patchy nodular density just above the right lung probably infectious or inflammatory in origin. Suggest follow-up chest radiograph to document appropriate resolution.

Multiplanar reconstructions were generated. All CT data was transferred to a 3D workstation for multiplanar reformation and 3D reconstruction under concurrent physician supervision. All CT scans at this facility use dose modulation, iterative reconstruction, and/or weight based dosing when appropriate to reduce radiation dose to as low as reasonably achievable. COMPARISON: Radiographs February 11, 2024 FINDINGS: Left ACJ again noted. Scattered atherosclerotic calcifications including coronary artery calcifications. Cardiomegaly. Filling defects are seen in the main or lobar pulmonary arteries or in the upper lobe segmental pulmonary arteries. The lower lobe segmental branches are poorly opacified and cannot be evaluated. No thoracic lymphadenopathy. Small bilateral pleural effusions. No pericardial effusion. Mild bilateral interstitial edema Mild to moderate centrilobular emphysema. There are additional patchy opacities in the middle lobe, lingular, and less prominent in the basal lower lobes. The central airways appear patent. No acute abnormalities in the upper abdomen. No acute bone abnormalities. IMPRESSION: Impression: No central or distal upper lobe pulmonary embolism identified. The right and left lower lobe segmental branches are poorly opacified resulting in suboptimal evaluation for pulmonary embolism. Cardiomegaly Mild bilateral interstitial edema Patchy opacities in the basal regions of the right middle lobe and lingular, and less prominently throughout the basilar right left lower lobes, most consistent with pneumonia.

            "answer": "CTA CHEST FOR PE DATE OF EXAM: 02/11/2024, 2311 INDICATION: Pulmonary embolism (PE) suspected, positive D-dimer TECHNIQUE: Using multidetector CT, contrast enhanced chest CT was performed. Three-dimensional (MIP) reconstructions were performed. Three-dimensional coronal and sagittal MIP reconstructions were performed. All CT scans at this facility use dose modulation, iterative reconstruction, and/or weight based dosing when appropriate to reduce radiation dose to as low as reasonably achievable. CONTRAST: Isovue 370 75 mL COMPARISON: CT chest dated 10/29/2022 FINDINGS: Suboptimal evaluation due to motion artifact. Suboptimal evaluation due to streak artifact from retained venous contrast CTA: Contrast bolus timing allows for adequate evaluation to the level of the segmental pulmonary arteries. No filling defect to suggest pulmonary embolus. Normal caliber of the main pulmonary trunk. Thyroid: Visualized portions are unremarkable. Thoracic inlet: Bulky left thoracic lymphadenopathy measuring 4.4 x 2.8 cm on series 17 image 60. Interval increase in size since 10/29/2022 The mass encases the left common carotid and left subclavian arteries Mediastinum and hila: Poor evaluation for mediastinal or hilar adenopathy due to the phase of contrast, though mediastinal lymphadenopathy is suspected. Thoracic esophagus is unremarkable. Heart and great vessels: Heart is normal in size. No pericardial effusion. The bolus was injected at the left upper extremity, but no contrast is seen at the left subclavian vein, innominate vein, or superior vena cava. Numerous contrast opacified venous collaterals of the chest wall and azygous/hemiazygous system. Lungs, airway and pleura: Central airways are patent and normal in caliber. There is a suspected mass at the left upper lobe adjacent to the hilum, measuring 3.6 x 6.8 x 6.7 cm, series 7 image 101 series 5 image 127. There is invasion of the mediastinal fat at the level of the AP window. There is a moderate left and trace right pleural effusion. There is suspected pulmonary edema, new since 2022, on a background of chronic lung disease which is not significant changed 10/29/2022. There is atelectasis at the left lower lobes along the effusions. Breast and axilla: No chest wall mass. Gynecomastia. No axillary adenopathy. Upper Abdomen: Visualized portions of the upper abdomen are unremarkable. Bones/Soft tissues: L2 superior endplate compression fracture suspected. No thoracic compression fracture. Mild multilevel thoracic spondylosis. No lytic lesion. IMPRESSION: 1. No evidence of pulmonary embolism to the segmental pulmonary arterial level. 2. A mass at the left upper lobe adjacent to the hilum, measuring 3.6 x 6.8 x 6.7 cm. Suspect primary neoplasm. There is invasion of the mediastinal fat at the level of the AP window. 3. Bulky left thoracic inlet lymphadenopathy, likely represents metastasis. This results in obstruction of the left subclavian/innominate vein. Numerous contrast opacified venous collaterals of the chest wall and azygous/hemiazygous system. 4. The left thoracic inlet mass encases the left common carotid and subclavian arteries. 5. Moderate left and trace right pleural effusions, possibly a malignant effusion on the left. 6. A background of chronic lung disease, with suspected superimposed pulmonary edema.

One of the following dose optimization techniques was utilized in the performance of this exam: Automated exposure control; adjustment of the mA and/or kV according to the patient's size; or use of an iterative reconstruction technique. Specific details can be referenced in the facility's radiology CT exam operational policy. CONTRAST: 80 mL Isovue-370. COMPARISON: None. FINDINGS: Heart/vessels: Satisfactory opacification of the pulmonary arteries. Small-volume saddle pulmonary filling defect with additional small/moderate volume defects extending into the left lower lobe segmental and subsegmental branches. Additional small/moderate volume filling defects within segmental branches of the left upper lobe, right upper lobe, right middle lobe, and right lower lobe. Overall, moderate volume filling defects. No definitive evidence for right heart strain although evaluation is suboptimal secondary to motion. Mediastinum: Small thyroid nodules measuring up to approximately 1.2 cm. Lymph nodes: Negative. Lungs/pleura: Interstitial consolidation within the left lower lobe, most compatible with a developing pulmonary infarct. Small adjacent pleural effusion and atelectasis. 6 x 6 mm solid left lower lobe pulmonary nodule (image 172 of series 7). 3 mm subpleural right middle lobe pulmonary nodule (image 184). Visualized upper abdomen: Mild atherosclerosis. No free fluid or lymphadenopathy.. Peripherally calcified splenic artery aneurysm measuring up to 8 mm. Bones/soft tissues: No acute or concerning abnormality. IMPRESSION: 1. Positive for pulmonary embolus with overall moderate volume filling defects, as above. No definitive evidence for right heart strain although evaluation is suboptimal secondary to motion. Echocardiogram is suggested for further evaluation. 2. Interstitial consolidation within the left lower lobe, most compatible with a developing pulmonary infarct. Small adjacent pleural effusion and atelectasis. 3. Incidental note of a small pulmonary nodules, the largest of which measures up to 6 mm. Please see follow-up recommendations, below. 4. Additional incidental/chronic findings, as above. RECOMMENDATION Pulmonary nodule: Non-contrast chest CT at 3-6 months is recommended. If the nodules are stable at time of repeat CT, then future CT at 18-24 months (from today's scan) is considered optional for low-risk patients, but is recommended for high-risk patients (Per Fleischner Society guidelines). Thyroid nodule: No follow-up recommended unless deemed clinically necessary. Results were discussed with BRANDON MICHAEL UTTLEY at 2/13/2024 4:08 PM.

Representative images have been stored on PACS. One of the following dose optimization techniques was utilized in the performance of this exam: Automated exposure control; adjustment of the mA and/or kV according to the patient's size; or use of an iterative reconstruction technique. Specific details can be referenced in the facility's radiology CT exam operational policy. CONTRAST: 100 mL of IV Isovue-370. COMPARISON: CTA chest 2/9/2019 FINDINGS: CTA CHEST: Please note that this exam is optimized for assessment of the pulmonary arteries and is not intended as a diagnostic study of the thoracic aorta, coronary arteries or venous structures. Angiographic Findings: Pulmonary arteries: New filling defects within subsegmental pulmonary artery branches in the anterior-inferior right upper lobe and right middle lobe (series 2, images 127 and image 163). Enlargement of the central pulmonary arteries is similar to prior. Other vasculature: Status post TAVR. Mild calcified plaque along the thoracic aorta. Unchanged borderline enlargement of the ascending aorta. Additional non-angiographic findings: Lower neck: Negative. Lungs / Pleura: No focal airspace consolidation. Possible small left pleural effusion though this may be overestimated due to streak artifact from hardware. Scattered calcified granulomas. Mild dependent left lower lobe atelectasis. Mediastinum / Hila: Small hiatal hernia. No mediastinal or hilar lymphadenopathy. Heart / Pericardium: Stable heart size without evidence of right heart strain. No pericardial effusion. Musculoskeletal / Body wall: Thoracic posterior spinal fixation hardware. Upper abdomen: Dictated separately. IMPRESSION: 1. Acute subsegmental pulmonary emboli within the right upper and lower lobes. No evidence of right heart strain. 2. Possible small left pleural effusion though this may be overestimated due to streak artifact from hardware. 3. Chronic and incidental findings as above.

TECHNIQUE: Pulmonary embolus protocol - Thin-slice axial imaging of the chest was performed during maximal pulmonary arterial opacification with intravenous nonionic iodinated contrast. 3D coronal slab MIPs and 2D reconstructions in the coronal and sagittal planes were performed to aid in pulmonary embolus detection. Representative images have been stored on PACS. Of note, the initial contrast bolus was suboptimal and the patient was injected and scanned a second time. One of the following dose optimization techniques was utilized in the performance of this exam: Automated exposure control; adjustment of the mA and/or kV according to the patient's size; or use of an iterative reconstruction technique. Specific details can be referenced in the facility's radiology CT exam operational policy. CONTRAST: 163 mL of IV Isovue-370. COMPARISON: CT chest 7/29/2023 FINDINGS: CTA CHEST: Please note that this exam is optimized for assessment of the pulmonary arteries and is not intended as a diagnostic study of the thoracic aorta, coronary arteries or venous structures. Angiographic Findings: Pulmonary arteries: On both acquisitions there is moderate respiratory motion artifact which limits evaluation of the smaller pulmonary arteries. There are no filling defects in the main, right, left, lobar or visualized segmental branches of the pulmonary arterial system. Other vasculature: Negative. Additional non-angiographic findings: Lower neck: Negative. Lungs / Pleura: Small left pleural effusion. Probable mild atelectasis in the lower left lung along the heart. Otherwise mild scattered linear scarring and/or atelectasis in both lungs. The central airways appear clear. Mediastinum / Hila: No mediastinal or hilar lymphadenopathy. Heart / Pericardium: Small pericardial effusion is new from prior. Stable size of the cardiac chambers. Multivessel coronary artery calcification. Musculoskeletal / Body wall: Negative. Upper abdomen: Small hiatal hernia with evidence of prior hiatal hernia repair. IMPRESSION: 1. No evidence of pulmonary embolism within the confines of respiratory motion artifact. 2. Small pericardial effusion. 3. Small left pleural effusion. 4. Probable left lower lung atelectasis though with components of consolidation not excluded. 5.

            "answer": "EXAM: CTA CHEST FOR PE CLINICAL DATA: Pulmonary embolism (PE) suspected, positive D-dimer, shortness of breath, cough TECHNICAL DATA: Contrast-enhanced CT pulmonary CT angiogram of the chest was performed with IV contrast. Multiplanar reconstructions were generated. All CT data was transferred to a 3D workstation for multiplanar reformation and 3D reconstruction under concurrent physician supervision. All CT scans at this facility use dose modulation, iterative reconstruction, and/or weight based dosing when appropriate to reduce radiation dose to as low as reasonably achievable. COMPARISON: Radiographs February 20, 2024 FINDINGS: There is a large saddle embolism occluding the main right pulmonary artery, and extending into the main left pulmonary artery. Thrombus is also seen within the right upper, middle, and lower lobar and segmental branches, left lower lobe and left upper lobe segmental branches. There is enlargement of the right ventricle when compared to the left. Scattered atherosclerotic calcifications including coronary artery calcifications. No thoracic lymphadenopathy. No pleural effusion. No pericardial effusion. No acute lung abnormalities. 12 mm subpleural left lower lobe nodule (series 900 image 103).. The central airways appear patent. No acute abnormalities in the upper abdomen. No acute bone abnormalities. IMPRESSION: Impression: Extensive bilateral pulmonary emboli, including central saddle embolism. There is evidence for right heart strain. Coronary arterial disease. 12 mm subpleural left lower lobe nodule. -Recommend nonemergent characterization with PET/CT.

            "answer": "EXAM: CTA CHEST FOR PE CLINICAL DATA: Pulmonary embolism (PE) suspected, unknown D-dimer TECHNICAL DATA: Contrast-enhanced CT pulmonary CT angiogram of the chest was performed with IV contrast. Multiplanar reconstructions were generated. All CT data was transferred to a 3D workstation for multiplanar reformation and 3D reconstruction under concurrent physician supervision. All CT scans at this facility use dose modulation, iterative reconstruction, and/or weight based dosing when appropriate to reduce radiation dose to as low as reasonably achievable. COMPARISON: Radiographs February 22, 2024 FINDINGS: Filling defects are seen within the right and left lower lobar and segmental pulmonary artery branches and left upper lobe segmental branches. There are findings of heart strain including enlargement of the right ventricle when compared to the left. Coronary artery calcifications noted. No thoracic lymphadenopathy. No pleural effusion. No pericardial effusion. Diffuse bilateral airspace and ground glass opacities, a mostly central distribution most prominent at the bases. . No significant lung nodule or lung mass. The central airways appear patent. No acute abnormalities in the upper abdomen. No acute bone abnormalities. IMPRESSION: Impression: Bilateral lobar and segmental branch pulmonary emboli. There is evidence for right heart strain. Extensive bilateral basilar predominant airspace opacities, likely infectious.

One of the following dose optimization techniques was utilized in the performance of this exam: Automated exposure control; adjustment of the mA and/or kV according to the patient's size; or use of an iterative reconstruction technique. Specific details can be referenced in the facility's radiology CT exam operational policy. CONTRAST: 75 mL Isovue-370. COMPARISON: None. FINDINGS: PULMONARY CTA FINDINGS: Limited evaluation due to motion artifact.. There is no acute pulmonary embolism to the first subsegmental pulmonary artery level. OTHER FINDINGS: Support Devices: None. Heart/Pericardium/Great Vessels: Cardiac size is mildly enlarged. There is no calcific coronary artery atherosclerosis. There is no pericardial effusion. There is mild thoracic aortic and branch vessel atherosclerosis, portions calcific. The main pulmonary artery is dilated measuring up to 3.9 cm in diameter. Pleural Spaces: The pleural spaces are clear. Mediastinum/Hila: There is no mediastinal or hilar lymph node enlargement. Neck Base/Chest Wall/Diaphragm/Upper Abdomen: Enlarged left thyroid lobe with a potential 2.4 cm hypoattenuating lesion in the left inferior thyroid lobe (9/183). There is calcific atherosclerosis of the right axillary artery. There is no supraclavicular or axillary lymph node enlargement. Limited imaging through the upper abdomen is within normal limits. Mild degenerative change is present in the spine. Lungs/Central Airways: A trace amount of dependent mucous cyst noted in the posterior trachea. No focal consolidation. A 5 mm nodule is noted in the basilar right lower lobe (7/199), and two adjacent 4 mm nodules are noted in the posterior apical left upper lobe (7/72, 67). IMPRESSION: No acute pulmonary embolism to the first subsegmental level. The main pulmonary artery is dilated, which can be seen in setting of pulmonary hypertension. Mild cardiomegaly. Calcific atherosclerosis of thoracic and visualized abdominal aorta, which is more than expected for the patient's age. Enlarged left inferior thyroid lobe with a potential 2.4 cm nodule. Follow-up with thyroid ultrasound is recommended. Pulmonary nodules measuring up to 5 mm, for which follow-up is recommended based on the following Fleischner guideline. Fleischner Society 2017 Guidelines*: For patients at low clinical risk** in whom multiple incidental solid nodules measuring < 6 mm are identified, no routine imaging follow-up is suggested. For patients at high clinical risk** in whom multiple incidental solid nodules measuring < 6 mm are identified, a follow up chest CT at 12 may be considered (particularly if one or more nodules are upper lobe in location or have suspicious morphology) depending on comorbidity and patient preferences.

One of the following dose optimization techniques was utilized in the performance of this exam: Automated exposure control; adjustment of the mA and/or kV according to the patient's size; or use of an iterative reconstruction technique. Specific details can be referenced in the facility's radiology CT exam operational policy. CONTRAST: 65 mL Isovue-370 COMPARISON: CT chest dated 1/5/2023, 8/23/2019. FINDINGS: PULMONARY CTA FINDINGS: Limited evaluation due to motion in the lung bases. There is no acute pulmonary embolism to the first segmental pulmonary artery level. OTHER FINDINGS: Support Devices: A left PICC terminates at the level of the proximal SVC. An enteric tube is seen coursing through the esophagus and exits out of the field of view. Heart/Pericardium/Great Vessels: Cardiac size is normal. There is mild calcific coronary artery atherosclerosis. There is no pericardial effusion. There is mild thoracic aortic and branch vessel atherosclerosis, portions calcific. The main pulmonary artery is borderline dilated measuring up to 3.0 cm in diameter. Pleural Spaces: The pleural spaces are clear. Mediastinum/Hila: There is no mediastinal or hilar lymph node enlargement. Neck Base/Chest Wall/Diaphragm/Upper Abdomen: There is no supraclavicular or axillary lymph node enlargement. Limited imaging through the upper abdomen is within normal limits. Mild degenerative change is present in the spine. Lungs/Central Airways: The trachea and central airways are clear. There is subsegmental atelectasis predominantly in the posterior lower lobes. There are a few scattered cysts. A 6 mm solid nodule is noted in the basilar right middle lobe (series 4 image 187), not significant changed compared to prior CT dating back to 2019, compatible with a benign nodule. IMPRESSION: 1. No acute pulmonary embolism to the segmental level within limits of the study (limited evaluation due to motion artifact). 2. Subsegmental atelectasis in the posterior lower lobes, otherwise no acute abnormality in the chest. Report E-Signed By: Lucy Lester, MD at 2/25/2024 10:58 PM WSN:AMICRAD90",

            "answer": "EXAM DATE: 2/27/2024 5:23 AM PROCEDURES: CTA CHEST FOR PE CLINICAL DATA: Pulmonary embolism (PE) suspected, high prob COMPARISON: Chest x-rays from the same day. TECHNICAL DATA: Helical CT data through the chest after the uneventful intravenous administration of 80 ml of Isovue 370. Sagittal, and coronal reformats were created by the technologist. Post-processed, reconstructed multiplanar reformatted MIP images of the chest were also provided. All CT scans at this facility use dose modulation, iterative reconstruction, and/or weight based dosing when appropriate to reduce radiation dose to as low as reasonably achievable. FINDINGS: Mediastinum:Normal appearance of the thyroid. Prominent and enlarged lymph nodes are seen scattered throughout the mediastinum and right greater than left hilum. The largest node is seen in the right hilum measuring approximately 1.3 cm in short axis. Opacification of the pulmonary arteries is suboptimal for evaluation of pulmonary embolus on this exam. No large central pulmonary arterial filling defects are seen within stated limitations of this exam. The pulmonary arteries and thoracic aorta are normal in course and caliber. Upper limits of normal cardiac size. No pericardial effusion. Reflux of contrast material is seen from the right atrium into the inferior vena cava and hepatic veins which raises suspicion for possible right heart dysfunction. Normal appearance of the esophagus. Lungs and pleura: Evaluation of the pulmonary parenchyma is somewhat limited due to respiratory motion throughout this examination which most significantly limits evaluation of the midlungs and lung bases. Within this limitation, no dense areas of consolidation are seen however, there is suggestion of scattered hazy areas of increased density in the inferior lower lobes which may represent areas of developing consolidation in the appropriate clinical setting. No pneumothorax or pleural effusions. Normal appearance of the trachea and mainstem bronchi. Chest wall: No axillary lymphadenopathy. Normal appearance of the musculature of the chest wall. No soft tissue masses. Bones: No acute or suspicious osseous findings. Upper abdomen: Hypoattenuation of the hepatic parenchyma is seen on this exam suspicious for hepatic steatosis. Remaining imaged hollow and solid organs of the visible portions of the upper abdomen show no acute or suspicious findings. IMPRESSION: 1. Evaluation of the pulmonary arteries is suboptimal for evaluation of pulmonary embolus on this exam. No large central pulmonary arterial filling defects are seen. 2. Evaluation of the pulmonary parenchyma is somewhat limited due to respiratory motion throughout this examination which most significantly limits evaluation of the midlungs and lung bases. Within this limitation, no dense areas of consolidation are seen however, there is suggestion of scattered hazy areas of increased density in the inferior lower lobes which may represent areas of developing consolidation in the appropriate clinical setting. 3. Prominent and enlarged lymph nodes are seen scattered throughout the mediastinum and right greater than left hilum. The largest node is seen in the right hilum measuring approximately 1.3 cm in short axis. 4. Reflux of contrast material is seen from the right atrium into the inferior vena cava and hepatic veins which raises suspicion for possible right heart dysfunction. 5. Hypoattenuation of the hepatic parenchyma is seen on this exam suspicious for hepatic steatosis. Correlate for clinical signs or symptoms of steatohepatitis.

CT abdomen and pelvis performed 9/22/2019 and 6/6/2022 TECHNICAL DATA: Helical CT data through the chest after the uneventful intravenous administration of 75 ml of Isovue 370. Sagittal, and coronal reformats were created by the technologist. Post-processed, reconstructed multiplanar reformatted MIP images of the chest were also provided. All CT scans at this facility use dose modulation, iterative reconstruction, and/or weight based dosing when appropriate to reduce radiation dose to as low as reasonably achievable. FINDINGS: Mediastinum:Normal appearance of the thyroid. No mediastinal or hilar lymphadenopathy. . Opacification of the pulmonary arteries is appropriate for evaluation of pulmonary embolus on this exam. Chronic, partially calcified pulmonary embolus is seen within the distal right main pulmonary artery obstructing lobar and segmental pulmonary arterial branches to the right middle lobe. No acute pulmonary embolus is identified throughout the right or left lungs. Dilation of the main and central pulmonary arteries is again noted. The thoracic aorta appears normal in course and caliber. Upper limits of normal cardiac size. Densely calcified atherosclerotic plaque deposition is seen in the distribution of the left main, LAD, circumflex and right coronary arteries. Normal appearance of the esophagus. Lungs and pleura: No focal nodules or consolidations. No pleural effusions or pneumothorax. Normal appearance of the trachea and mainstem bronchi. Chest wall: No axillary lymphadenopathy. Normal appearance of the musculature of the chest wall. No soft tissue masses. Bones: No acute or suspicious osseous findings. Upper abdomen: Small radiodense gallstones are seen within the dependent gallbladder lumen. The gallbladder otherwise appears within normal limits. There is an indeterminate circumscribed intermediate attenuation exophytic lesion seen arising in the anterior interpole right kidney which is incompletely evaluated on this exam although appears stable compared with prior imaging dating back to at least 9/22/2019, likely representing a cyst containing radiodense debris. IMPRESSION: 1. No acute pulmonary embolus is identified. 2. Chronic, partially calcified pulmonary embolus is seen within the distal right main pulmonary artery obstructing lobar and segmental pulmonary arterial branches to the right middle lobe. 3. Dilation of the main and central pulmonary arteries is again noted. Correlate for clinical signs or symptoms of pulmonary arterial hypertension. 4. Coronary artery disease and other chronic and incidental findings as above. Report E-Signed By: Jason M Allen, DO at 2/29/2024 2:27 AM WSN:RICRADHOME11",

TECHNIQUE: Spiral CT obtained through the thorax after the administration of intravenous contrast. Sagittal and coronal reconstructed images are presented. 3-D MIP sequences are also presented which were performed on a separate workstation by the technologist. One or more of the following dose reduction techniques were utilized: automated exposure control, mA and/or kV adjustment according to the patient's size, and or iterative reconstruction technique. COMPARISON: CT chest 2/6/2024, CT abdomen and pelvis 2/4/2024 FINDINGS: Technically limited exam, with incomplete evaluation of the subsegmental pulmonary arteries. Vessels:Multiple filling defects involving segmental branches of the pulmonary arteries bilaterally with overall small clot burden on limited evaluation. Imaging of the subsegmental vessels is suboptimal. Lungs:Inspissated material within the trachea and bilateral main bronchi. New patchy consolidation within the medial and inferior aspect of the right upper lobe. Increased partial atelectasis of the right lower lobe secondary to pleural effusion. New post obstructive consolidation in the anterior aspect of the right upper lobe which is relatively hypodense in attenuation. No internal gas. Unchanged spiculated nodule in the right middle lobe. No significant pulmonary interstitial edema. New partial atelectasis of left lower lobe secondary to pleural effusion. Pleural space:Increase moderate right pleural effusion and new small left pleural effusion. No pneumothorax. No obvious pleural implants. Heart and mediastinum: No obvious right heart strain. Moderate biatrial enlargement with likely associated reflux of contrast into the hepatic veins. No pericardial effusion. Decreased size of mediastinal mass centered in the right upper paratracheal region that now measures 5.6 x 5.7 cm, previously 7.9 x 6.5 cm. Bones:Unchanged compression fractures of T10 and T11. No acute fracture. Chest wall:Unremarkable. Upper abdomen:Unremarkable on limited evaluation. MIP/3D: No additional concerning findings. IMPRESSION: Impression: 1. Multiple acute pulmonary emboli involving segmental branches of the pulmonary arteries bilaterally with overall small clot burden on limited evaluation. No obvious right heart strain. 2. New postobstructive consolidation in the anterior aspect of the right upper lobe which is relatively hypodense in attenuation and concerning for developing pulmonary abscess or infarct. Additional differential includes new neoplasm though this is felt to be less likely given short-term interval development. 3. New patchy consolidation in the medial and inferior aspect of the right upper lobe likely secondary to aspiration. 4. Increased moderate right pleural effusion and new small left pleural effusion with associated partial atelectasis of the bilateral lower lobes. 5. Decreased size of mediastinal mass centered in the right upper paratracheal region. Unchanged spiculated nodule in the right middle lobe. 6. Moderate biatrial enlargement with likely associated reflux of contrast into the hepatic veins concerning for right heart dysfunction. 7. Unchanged compression fractures of T10 and T11.

One of the following dose optimization techniques was utilized in the performance of this exam: Automated exposure control; adjustment of the mA and/or kV according to the patient's size; or use of an iterative reconstruction technique. Specific details can be referenced in the facility's radiology CT exam operational policy. CONTRAST: 75 mL Isovue-370 COMPARISON: CT chest May 16, 2022. FINDINGS: Pulmonary arteries: There is nonopacification of the segmental right lower lobe pulmonary artery leading to wedge-shaped area of consolidation, suspicious for pulmonary embolism with subsequent pulmonary infarct. There is some contrast layering within multiple lower lobe pulmonary arteries which could be due to poor cardiac output, but other pulmonary arteries at this level still opacify and there is an expanded appearance of this artery when compared with the prior examination. Dilated main pulmonary artery, correlate for pulmonary hypertension. Heart/vessels: There is atherosclerotic vascular disease in the aorta and its branches. Coronary artery calcifications. Aortic valve leaflet calcifications. Four-chamber cardiomegaly. Mediastinum: Negative. Lymph nodes: Trace bilateral pleural effusions. Moderate to severe emphysema. Lungs/pleura: Negative. Visualized upper abdomen: Negative. Bones/soft tissues: Degenerative changes in the spine. IMPRESSION: Filling defect in the right lower lobe subsegmental pulmonary artery, somewhat difficult to evaluate due to poor opacification of the pulmonary arteries at this level but favor pulmonary embolism. There is a wedge-shaped area of consolidation distally, suspicious for pulmonary infarct. Superimposed infection not excluded. Trace bilateral pleural effusions.
