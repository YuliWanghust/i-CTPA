the checkpoint file was fine-tuned on the following dataset:

CTPA dataset: To develop and evaluate the i-CTPA, we assembled a multi-institutional cohort of 23,942 patients (>50,000 CTPA studies) from four hospitals to enable robust training and external validation. i-CTPA was developed at Johns Hopkins University (JHU) and validated across multiple external institutions, including the University of Colorado (CU), Stanford University (INSPECT dataset), and Xiangya Hospital (Xiangya) in China.
